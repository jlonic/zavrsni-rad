At a fan event that took place in June 2018, Swift described the record as a story of “finding love throughout all the noise,” referring to how the album transitions from discussing her persona to falling in love with British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nOn its first day alone, the album sold 700,000 physical copies, and it debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, having sold more copies that week than the other 199 listed albums combined. Within a month, the record was certified triple platinum, becoming RIAA’s top-certified album of the year, and even a year after its release, it was deemed the biggest album of 2018 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThe album was announced after Swift removed all previous social media presence and uploaded three videos of a snake’s tail, body, and head in August 2017; most considered this a reference to the “snake” nickname she was given after it was revealed she wrote Calvin Harris' “This Is What You Came For” after their breakup, which worsened during public fallouts with Kanye West and Katy Perry.\n\nTo promote the album, Swift teamed up with Target to produce two exclusive magazines which feature poetry, paintings, handwritten lyrics, and a behind-the-scenes look at the music video for lead single “Look What You Made Me Do.” She worked with UPS leading up to the album’s release, and partnered with Ticketmaster to help dedicated fans be the first to score tickets to her 2018 tour.	f

Reviews described it as a classic pop record expanding from Swift's country roots into electronic, synth-pop and rock flairs, whilst chronicling various dynamics of love, life, loss and heartache. The album broke a string of commercial records, such as the Spotify feat for the largest single-day streams for an album by a female artist and the biggest vinyl sales week in MRC Data history. It topped the charts in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom, as well as the United States where Swift surpassed Elton John's 46-year-old record to become the fastest soloist in Billboard 200 history to collect four number-one albums, doing so in under 16 months.	f

A surprise album announced without pre-release promotion, folklore was written and recorded while in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Categorized as an indie folk, alternative rock, electro-folk, and chamber pop record, the album marks a departure from the upbeat pop sound of Swift's preceding studio albums to stripped-down tunes driven by piano and guitar, with production from Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Swift herself. Folklore portrays what Swift called "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness" rising out of her imagination. It manifests vivid storytelling from largely third-person narratives that detail heartbreak and retrospection.\n\nUpon release, Folklore received widespread critical acclaim, with emphasis on its sonic coherence, relaxed atmosphere and poetic lyricism. It broke numerous records on streaming services, including the Guinness World Record for the biggest opening day for an album by a female artist on Spotify. The album sold two million copies in its first week globally, 1.3 million of which were sold on its first day. Folklore reached number one in Australia, Canada, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and several other territories.\n\nIn the United States, Folklore debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with 846,000 units moved, garnering Swift's seventh consecutive number-one album in the country and marked the largest sales week for an album in 2020. All 16 tracks of Folklore debuted simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with three in the top-10: the lead single "cardigan" debuted at number one, giving Swift her sixth number-one single in the US, making her the first act in history to debut atop both the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts in the same week, while "the 1" entered at number 4, with the Bon Iver collaboration "exile" at number 6; the three tracks also debuted inside the top-10 in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the UK. By the end of its third week, Folklore earned over one million units in the US—the fastest album of 2020 to do so.	f

Announced at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, the album marks Swift's first body of new work since her ninth studio album, evermore. Swift wrote and produced Midnights with Jack Antonoff and described the album as a "journey through terrors and sweet dreams" that describes thirteen sleepless nights of her life.\n\nFollowing the surprise release and negligible promotion of her previous studio albums, Swift returned to her traditional album roll-out with Midnights. She unveiled the track list through a TikTok series called 'Midnights Mayhem with Me' from September 21 to October 7, 2022. The fourth track, "Snow on the Beach", features Lana Del Rey.\n\nSwift adopted a glamorous aesthetic for Midnights that drew from 1970s fashion. A trailer teasing several visuals for the album was released on October 20. A music video for the third track, "Anti-Hero", was premiered on October 21, 2022.\n\nThe standard edition of Midnights consists of thirteen tracks. The deluxe CD adds three bonus songs, of which two are remixes, while Midnights (3am Edition), made available exclusively on streaming platforms and for digital download, adds seven other bonus tracks. Six of the album's tracks are labeled explicit. Del Rey provides guest vocals on the fourth track, "Snow on the Beach".\n\nMidnights was met with widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised its restrained production, candid songwriting, and vocal cadences. The album was also a major commercial success across all formats of music consumption; it broke the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for an album, and became the fastest-selling album in the United States since Swift's own reputation, finishing its first day as the best-selling album of 2022 and logging the largest vinyl sales week of the 21st century, marked Swift's 11th number-one album on the Billboard 200, and spawned 10 top-ten songs on the Hot 100 "the most for any album" in the same week. To support Midnights, Swift will embark on the Eras Tour in 2023.\n\nBillboard called Swift's unexpected announcement of the album at the Video Music Awards a "headline-grabbing" moment. Bruce Gillmer, the show's producer, stated that Midnights gave a "massive lift" to the viewership ratings. The album's cover artwork became an internet trend, mimicked and parodied by social media users, including official accounts of brands, organizations and celebrities. Apple Fitness+ released three exercise programs designed around Swift's music, featuring tracks from Midnights, curated for yoga, treadmill and HITT workouts. Spotify's servers crashed for several minutes when the album was released.\n\nThe commercial success of Midnights across all formats was unprecedented in the streaming era. Financial Times pondered whether Swift is "the last pop superstar", underscoring the 1.5 million first-week units—a figure unseen since the "1990s boy bands" era, which was regarded as the peak for the US music business. Music publisher Matt Pincus called Swift "basically an intellectual property franchise now. Like a DC movie". Fortune compared her to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Noting a 2021 article from The New York Times that asked "if Adele couldn't sell more than a million albums in a single week, could any artist?" after her album 30 missed the mark, Rolling Stone responded that Swift "has once again moved the goalposts regarding what the music industry can see as possible from a major pop star". Slate underscored how Swift's career has lasted longer than that of the Beatles, and broke the band's once-deemed "unbeatable" records. Business journalist Greg Jericho, in The Guardian, lauded her ability to remain culturally relevant and successful 18 years into her music career, highlighting how the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen were past their prime at that stage.	f

Would it have been better if I didn't know. Facing the face of the truth is sometimes cruel. In a place where light and darkness intertwined, we now decide to ignore the laws and rules of this world. Move a little more boldly to make a sound that will reap the darkness.\n\nGender, origin, age, religion, and country do not matter. As long as there is music that makes your heart beat. The rhythm that wakes me up in me becomes a big wave, unravelling everything that has been tied up with people.\n\nWant a different kind of spicy?\n\nI can show you right now.\n\nIn the album's title song 'BOUNCY (K-HOT CHILLI PEPPERS)', ATEEZ flies over the music with the excitement that only they can draw. In this scene reminiscent of a genre movie, you'll face a heart that's raging together.\n\nThere is no stopping for those who are still hungry. Even for you who are listening to this music.\n\nSlow it down, make it BOUNCY.	f

To promote the album further, Eilish embarked on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, set to cover Europe, Oceania and North America in 2022.\n\nUpon release, Happier Than Ever received acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".	f

Written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the track, it is a breakup song composed of two distinct parts. It begins as a jazz and soft rock tune supported by guitar and singing style compared to Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey, before transitioning to an electronic section based on club beats, 1980s synths and Auto Tuned vocals. An extended version of the song's second part subtitled "Over Now" was released on May 22, 2024, as a promotional single.\n\nThe second part is a high-tempo and "hectic" disco, electropop, hyperpop, and synth-pop song with synths reminiscent of 1980s and Auto Tuned vocals. During this side, Eilish sings about the outcome of the breakup, as she lays with a woman telling her about her past lover–calling them "mediocre" and addressing that both of them are "glad" that the relationship ended. A "dark", "pinwheeling", and "pulsating" outro of the album track ends on lyrics: "Miss me / Say you miss me / It's such a pity / We're both so pretty". In an extended edit, Eilish swoops more biting words towards her previous lover, finishing the song singing: "I wasn't satiated / You're looking older lately / Dating another baby".\n\nThe ending has been compared to Charli XCX hyperpop material, as well as to The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" (2019). Eilish's attitude on the song was compared to her previous songs such as "Bitches Broken Hearts" and "Party Favor" (both 2018), while the sonicscape called back reviewers to "Happier Than Ever" (2021).	f

After it had originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002, the album was released on May 26, 2002, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records due to pirating and bootlegging of it. The album saw  Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, and Dr. Dre being the album's executive producers. It features guest appearances from Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae, and  Eminem's daughter Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers.\n\nThe album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than  Eminem's previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on  Eminem's prominence in hip-hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts about fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the War on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney, and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as  Eminem's most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nWidely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, "Without Me", "Cleanin' Out My Closet", "Superman", and "Sing for the Moment". The album was met with positive critical reviews, with praise directed at Eminem's mature, introspective lyricism and the album's experimental production.\n\nThe Eminem Show was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of over 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the third best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while "Without Me" won Best Music Video. Blender, Muzik and LAUNCH named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the 2000s decade.\n\nBackground\n\nSpeaking to Spin, Eminem said, "Eventually, I might need some drama in my life to inspire me  With The Marshall Mathers LP, everything that everybody was saying–I took that, and it was my ammo. And then when shit died down a little bit, I had other turmoil in my personal life, so that was what I was able to dump out on The Eminem Show. Now, I just gotta wait for the next phase of my life. But something always seems to happen, man; something's always gotta be fucking turbulent."\n\nEminem cited that the inspiration for the album was taken from the Peter Weir-directed 1998 science fiction comedy-drama film The Truman Show. Jim Carrey starred in the film as the lead character Truman Burbank, a man who unwittingly lives inside a TV show, where his life is broadcast to viewers around the world. Eminem spoke on the film's influence, saying, "My life felt like it was becoming a circus around that time, and I felt like I was always being watched  Basically, Jim Carrey wrote my album.\n\nRecording\n\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone in 2002, Eminem said ""Sing for the Moment" was the first song I wrote for the album; "Cleanin Out My Closet" was the second. I had the line in "Cleanin Out My Closet" — "I'd like to welcome y'all out to The Eminem Show" — and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, "My life is really like a fucking show." I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin' over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year  that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that's when half of the album was wrote.\n\nEminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming 8 Mile. Production was used for both the soundtrack of the film and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the songs which eventually, became the released singles). Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album's executive producer, produced only three individual tracks: "Business", "Say What You Say", and "My Dad's Gone Crazy". Regarding his increase in producing, Eminem told Rolling Stone, "I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple — just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I'm so into producing, it's a fucking job.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nStylistically, The Eminem Show has a lighter tone than The Marshall Mathers LP and incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem's previous albums, featuring mixed guitar-driven melodies with hip hop rhythms. In an interview with British magazine The Face in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record. He continued that he "tried to get the best of both worlds" on the album. Eminem spoke on specific rock influences, saying, "I listened to a lot of '70s rock growing up, when I was real little. When I go back and listen to them songs, like Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix...'70s rock had this incredible feel to it. Notably, "Sing For The Moment" contains a sample of Aerosmith's "Dream On" as well as a reinterpretation of its guitar solo. Another rock sample on the album is the kick-clap beat of "'Till I Collapse", which is an interpolation of the intro from Queen's "We Will Rock You".\n\nThe themes of The Eminem Show are predominantly based on Eminem's prominence in hip hop culture and the subsequent envy towards him, as well as his thoughts on his unexpected enormous success and its consequential negative effects on his life. The album also touches on Eminem's thoughts on themes surrounding American politics, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Speaking on his use of political commentary on the album, Eminem told Rolling Stone, "You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don't agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do. Writing for Spin, rock critic Alan Light said that the album may have proved that Eminem is the most "dexterous, vivid writer in pop music". The album also sees Eminem dissing several artists, including Mariah Carey, Moby, Canibus and Limp Bizkit, while Dr. Dre disses Jermaine Dupri on the song "Say What You Say".\n\nLyrically, the album shows Eminem's personal and musical growth with there being a lack of misogyny and homophobia compared to The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem told Spin, "One of the frustrating things was people saying, 'He's got to cuss to sell records,'  That's why with this album, I toned it down a bit as far as shock value. I wanted to show that I'm a solid artist, and I'm here to stay. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as a departure from Eminem's previous albums. with it being more personal and reflective and a step back of the Slim Shady alter ego. Eminem said during an interview with MTV that he felt that The Eminem Show was his "best record so far". In 2006, Q said that Eminem's first two albums "aired dirty laundry, then the world's most celebrated rapper  examined life in the hall of mirrors he'd built for himself.\n\nWith the release of The Eminem Show, Eminem was considered to be more socially acceptable: there were no protests over his lyrics, boycotts, and talk shows discussing his impact on America's youth. A columnist of The New York Observer wrote that Eminem had become a "guilty pleasure" for baby boomers, describing him as "the most compelling figure to have emerged from popular music since the holy trinity of  Dylan,  Lennon, and  Jagger.\n\nCensored version\n\nThe "clean version" of The Eminem Show censors many more profanities and derogatory words than in clean versions of Eminem's previous albums, in which the words "goddamn", "prick", "bastard", "piss", "bitch", "ass", and "shit" were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted, obscured by sound effects, or back-masked. In addition to this, entire sentences were sometimes removed from the censored version for being very sexually charged. The entire song "Drips" was removed in early clean versions and is heard only as four seconds of silence moving on to the next track, "Without Me". Later on, digital releases of the clean version removed "Drips" completely, moving the next 11 songs up on the tracklist. Some copies of the clean version, however, feature an edited version of "Drips".\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in clean version's censorship. In the skit "The Kiss", Eminem's shouting of the word "motherfucker!" is still audible in the censored version. In the track, "Soldier", which is a continuation of "The Kiss", the word "bitch" was used three times, and can be clearly heard once. "Hailie's Song" contains the back masked phrase "want her" which can be easily mistaken as "abort her" on both the explicit and clean versions. Also, in "White America", the word "flag" is back masked when he raps, "To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker".\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Eminem Show was met with generally positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews.\n\nAlex Needham of NME hailed The Eminem Show as a "fantastic third album" that "is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt the album's more personal lyrics "succeed in fleshing out Eminem's complexities and contradictions", nonetheless concluding that "ike its predecessors, though, The Eminem Show is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem's dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kris Ex argued that Eminem "may have made the best rap rock album in history.\n\nSlant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that he "peels back some of the bullshit façade and reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers" on an album that "displays a—dare I say it?—more 'mature' Eminem. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album "proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders". Critic Robert Christgau wrote: "I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem's changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers's worst traumas and the specifics of his success.\n\nEdna Gundersen of USA Today wrote that Eminem is "as good as he gets but in the end inflicts more damage on himself, hoisting The Eminem Show to a level of self-absorption rivaled only by Woody Allen", and despite the presence of some mediocre tracks, he "displays an admirable dexterity in blending invective and invention, even though his approach is more reactionary than revolutionary. Uncut wrote, "Behind the hype and the swagger, he's still baring enough of his soul for The Eminem Show to be compelling theatre. Q was more mixed in its assessment, stating that as "Eminem outgrows his old alter-id, so the obligatory pantomime villainy, skits and crass cameos by Shady Records signings become a hindrance. Marc L. Hill of PopMatters felt that the album lacked the shock factor of his previous albums and described it as "a disappointing combination of promising musical experimentation and uninspired lyrics.\n\nOn June 3, 2002, Pitchfork Media's Ethan P. published a review of The Eminem Show which infamously consisted of a meandering stream of consciousness monologue. While giving it a 9.1/10, P. vulgarly and comedically criticized various aspects of the album, including its lead singles, its lyrics, and especially "My Dad's Gone Crazy", which he described as a "saccharine-sweetened lemon incest gone faggy". The review, making use of line breaks and written entirely in lowercase, referred in one section to "the him fucking dre thing / dyeing your hair and wearing earrings thing from the aerosmith song / or hailie being 'the only lady he adores' / sleazy disco / little eric and erica / dre is batman and he's the burt ward robin / etc". Despite its comedically self-referential sections, including a paragraph where P. states "if you're reading this sentence then wow i really got an unedited review on pfork ", and several offhand remarks ("yeah dude timbaland is biting aphex twins white ass too haha i dunno fuck it here are some more bullshit things about the actual record like right on schedule pfork review style"), the review has remained on the Pitchfork website, and P.'s rating for The Eminem Show continues to be the publication's official rating of the album.\n\nBlender, Muzik and LAUNCH named The Eminem Show the best album of 2002. The album became Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while "Without Me" won Eminem his first Best Music Video award. The album swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The album also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, both Album of the Year and Top R&B/Hip Hop Album at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, both Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the 2003 American Music Awards, Best International Album at the 2003 Brit Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.\n\nReappraisal\n\nThe Eminem Show received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem's most personal and best work. The album cemented Eminem's "three-peat" of classic hip hop albums, following the critical appraisal of The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was later ranked at number 84 on the same magazine's Best Albums of the 2000s Decade. In 2007, it was ranked number 63 by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their list of the Definite 200 Albums of All Time. In 2012, Complex magazine deemed it a "classic" album that "cemented Eminem's place as one of the most important figures in rap history", and has included it on their list of 100 Best Albums of the Complex Decade, placing it at number 5, Following the 15th anniversary of the album, the Grammy Awards also described The Eminem Show as a "classic album". Popdose ranked the album at 79 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. In 2015, The Eminem Show was ranked number 56 on the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Eminem Show was originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootlegged copies appeared online via peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. It was provided by Rabid Neurosis (RNS), an MP3 warez release organisation who pirated the album twenty-five days prior to release. Radio show Opie and Anthony broadcast the entire album on May 17, 2002. Interscope decided to release the album earlier than planned, on May 28 to prevent bootlegging. However, many stores in the United States began selling it even earlier than the new release date on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, "America Couldn't Wait". Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. The Eminem Show was Eminem's first album to include lyrics to all its songs inside the CD booklet. Additionally, the first 2,000,000 copies of the album shipped in the United States included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. A week before the album's release, it was the second-most played CD on computers, the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. It was considered the most anticipated album of 2002.\n\nDespite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first day, marking the first time an album had topped the chart from only a day's sale. It sold 1,322,000 copies in the following week, its first full week of sales, then sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week to bring its four-week sales total to just under 3 million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the Billboard 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 10 million copies, making it Eminem's second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States. It has also achieved Diamond certification in Canada and Double Diamond in Australia.\n\nThe Eminem Show has sold 27 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and Eminem's best-selling album. It reached number one in 18 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart.	f

Eilish was nearly 18 at the time of recording, making her the youngest artist to have written and recorded a James Bond theme. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n"No Time to Die" debuted at top of the Irish Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart. It became Eilish's first number-one single in the UK and made her the first artist born in the 21st century to top the chart.

According to Roisin O'Connor of The Independent, the song "features classic elements of the most memorable Bond themes including a slow build; a dark, shivery theme; and dramatic orchestration".

The song features orchestral arrangements by Hans Zimmer as well as Johnny Marr on guitar.\n\nAccording to Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork, the lyrics reflect the "betrayal hinted at in the film's trailer and embody the tension of espionage".

It was released on December 6, 2005, under Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. The album collects  Eminem's most popular singles, as well as four new songs, including a live version of "Stan", featuring English singer and songwriter Elton John from the 43rd Grammy Awards, plus the songs "Fack", "When I'm Gone" and "Shake That" featuring Nate Dogg.\n\nThe album was certified septuple platinum in the United States and quintuple platinum in New Zealand. It reached number one on several charts, including the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart.\n\n"Curtain Call: The Hits" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and Billboard 200, after two sales days, in a similar fashion to  Eminem's previous album Encore. The album racked up first-week sales of nearly 441,000 and with close to 324,000 scans the second week for a two-week stay at number one. It slipped from number one to number four in its third week but surged 33 percent to finish with sales close to 430,000. The disc scored nearly 1.2 million scans in its first three weeks of release. It also gave Eminem his fifth straight number 1 album in the US and UK when including the 8 Mile soundtrack. As of November 2013, the record had sold 3,782,000 copies in the United States. "Curtain Call" was later certified septuple-platinum by the RIAA in the United States.\n\nThe album's two singles, "When I'm Gone" and "Shake That", peaked at numbers 8 and 6 respectively in the US Billboard Hot 100. Only "When I'm Gone" qualified for the charts in the UK, where it peaked at #4.\n\nIn August 2017, the album was declared the longest-running rap LP in the history of the Billboard 200.\n\nA clean version of the album is also available. It has 15 tracks with both "Intro" and "FACK" removed (due to the extreme sexual nature of the latter, and the former's connection to the song) and "My Name Is" put to track one. The tracks appear exactly how they appeared on the clean versions of their respective albums except for the song "Guilty Conscience", which uses the radio edit. Certain profanities remain on several tracks, as words including "shit", "bitch", and "ass" were not censored on "The Slim Shady LP" or "The Marshall Mathers LP". However, on "Just Lose It", the clean version leaves "ass" uncensored, while on the album Encore, the word "ass" was replaced with "thing".	f

The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and  Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including  Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip-hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing  Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised  Eminem's lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "I'm Back" and "Bitch Please II". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while "The Real Slim Shady" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album's sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann "Kim" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, "I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The "free" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to "map out" each song. He described himself as a "studio rat" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from "fucking around" in the studio; "Marshall Mathers" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while "Criminal" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. "Kill You" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n"Kim" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote "Kim" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. The song "Stan" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for "Stan" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard "Stan" and enjoyed it, and observed, "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote "The Way I Am" as his way of saying, "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs "liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the atmosphere of "Amityville". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem's major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics " the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to "dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, "Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Kill You"), the relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan", "I'm Back", and "Marshall Mathers"), his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"), his drug use ("Drug Ballad", "The Kids"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am", "Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes ("Criminal"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song "Criminal" features the line "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for "encourag violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. Eminem noted that he began using the word "faggot" more frequently when "people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse", but added, "I think it's hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, "Kill You", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper's first album, nightmares of "ladies' screams", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and "notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers'. The six-and-a-half minute long "Stan" samples Dido's "Thank You" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On "Who Knew", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem's response ranges oscillates from "smart-ass ('Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?') to smart ('Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?')."Who Knew" is followed by the "Steve Berman" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about "big-screen TVs, blunts, 40's, and bitches", while Eminem raps about "homosexuals and Vicodin", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n"The Way I Am" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being "pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. "The Real Slim Shady" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. "Remember Me?" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who "kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track". In the song, he states "I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image / So I promised the fuckin' critics / I wouldn't say 'fuckin' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)". Despite saying the word "fuck" one more time in "Remember Me", and three times at the beginning of "I'm Back", he does not say the word "fuckin" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song "Marshall Mathers".\n"I'm Back" features Eminem's observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he "became a commodity/'Cause I'm W-H-I-T-E". The next song, "Marshall Mathers", mocks the chorus of LFO's "Summer Girls", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. "Drug Ballad" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him "sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you". "Amityville" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. "Bitch Please II" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n"Kim", the prequel to "97 Bonnie and Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" "Kim" is followed by "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 "runs rampant" on the track. "Criminal" features production from F.B.T., which consists of "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...''. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that "half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP "resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like "ass", "bitch", "goddamn", and "shit" were uncensored. However, on the track "The Real Slim Shady", the words "bitch" and "shit" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs "Kill You", "Drug Ballad" and "Bitch Please II" are written as "**** You", "Ballad" and "***** Please II" on the back cover of the album. The song "Kim" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed "The Kids".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words "kids" and "Columbine" from the line, "I take seven  from , stand them all in line" from "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song "Rap God" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line "It doesn't matter  faggot" was also censored from "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album's first single, "The Real Slim Shady", became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. "The Way I Am", which was released as the album's second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. "Stan", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem's best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine's Touré applauded Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied lyrical style on what is a "car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem's startlingly intense vision of "rap's self-consciousness" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and "gruelling assault course of lyrical genius" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper's consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him "exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit", while declaring the album "a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is "indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was "mixed", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem's "verbal skills and transgressive humor" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, "docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem's "vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults" would "almost grow tedious if he weren't as inventive as he is tasteless." Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem's disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: "The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan's Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem's best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it "delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre." According to Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also "remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, "At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem's albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, "The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that "Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains "one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as "a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album's impact on white rappers, saying, "For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine's revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. Popdose listed The Marshall Mathers LP as the 10th best album of the decade. Spinner ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of "The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers". In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by About.com on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, The Marshall Mathers LP was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of Stacker, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for "promot violence of the most degrading kind against women", labeling him as "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape". She specifically cited lyrics from "Kill You", explaining, "He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has "long been a vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper "authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to "I'm Back" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, "Of course I'd heard of Elton John, but I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, "Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first" from "The Real Slim Shady", calling the rapper's claim "disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.\n\nIn 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song "Pulsion".	f

The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and  Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including  Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip-hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing  Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised  Eminem's lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "I'm Back" and "Bitch Please II". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while "The Real Slim Shady" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album's sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann "Kim" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, "I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The "free" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to "map out" each song. He described himself as a "studio rat" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from "fucking around" in the studio; "Marshall Mathers" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while "Criminal" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. "Kill You" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n"Kim" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote "Kim" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. The song "Stan" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for "Stan" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard "Stan" and enjoyed it, and observed, "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote "The Way I Am" as his way of saying, "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs "liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the atmosphere of "Amityville". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem's major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics " the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to "dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, "Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Kill You"), the relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan", "I'm Back", and "Marshall Mathers"), his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"), his drug use ("Drug Ballad", "The Kids"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am", "Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes ("Criminal"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song "Criminal" features the line "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for "encourag violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. Eminem noted that he began using the word "faggot" more frequently when "people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse", but added, "I think it's hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, "Kill You", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper's first album, nightmares of "ladies' screams", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and "notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers'. The six-and-a-half minute long "Stan" samples Dido's "Thank You" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On "Who Knew", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem's response ranges oscillates from "smart-ass ('Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?') to smart ('Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?')."Who Knew" is followed by the "Steve Berman" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about "big-screen TVs, blunts, 40's, and bitches", while Eminem raps about "homosexuals and Vicodin", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n"The Way I Am" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being "pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. "The Real Slim Shady" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. "Remember Me?" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who "kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track". In the song, he states "I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image / So I promised the fuckin' critics / I wouldn't say 'fuckin' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)". Despite saying the word "fuck" one more time in "Remember Me", and three times at the beginning of "I'm Back", he does not say the word "fuckin" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song "Marshall Mathers".\n"I'm Back" features Eminem's observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he "became a commodity/'Cause I'm W-H-I-T-E". The next song, "Marshall Mathers", mocks the chorus of LFO's "Summer Girls", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. "Drug Ballad" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him "sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you". "Amityville" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. "Bitch Please II" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n"Kim", the prequel to "97 Bonnie and Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" "Kim" is followed by "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 "runs rampant" on the track. "Criminal" features production from F.B.T., which consists of "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...''. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that "half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP "resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like "ass", "bitch", "goddamn", and "shit" were uncensored. However, on the track "The Real Slim Shady", the words "bitch" and "shit" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs "Kill You", "Drug Ballad" and "Bitch Please II" are written as "**** You", "Ballad" and "***** Please II" on the back cover of the album. The song "Kim" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed "The Kids".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words "kids" and "Columbine" from the line, "I take seven  from , stand them all in line" from "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song "Rap God" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line "It doesn't matter  faggot" was also censored from "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album's first single, "The Real Slim Shady", became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. "The Way I Am", which was released as the album's second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. "Stan", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem's best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine's Touré applauded Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied lyrical style on what is a "car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem's startlingly intense vision of "rap's self-consciousness" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and "gruelling assault course of lyrical genius" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper's consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him "exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit", while declaring the album "a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is "indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was "mixed", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem's "verbal skills and transgressive humor" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, "docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem's "vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults" would "almost grow tedious if he weren't as inventive as he is tasteless." Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem's disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: "The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan's Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem's best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it "delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre." According to Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also "remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, "At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem's albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, "The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that "Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains "one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as "a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album's impact on white rappers, saying, "For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine's revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. Popdose listed The Marshall Mathers LP as the 10th best album of the decade. Spinner ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of "The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers". In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by About.com on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, The Marshall Mathers LP was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of Stacker, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for "promot violence of the most degrading kind against women", labeling him as "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape". She specifically cited lyrics from "Kill You", explaining, "He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has "long been a vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper "authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to "I'm Back" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, "Of course I'd heard of Elton John, but I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, "Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first" from "The Real Slim Shady", calling the rapper's claim "disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.\n\nIn 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song "Pulsion".	f

It was released on May 19, 2009, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It was his first album of original material since Encore (2004), following a four-year hiatus from recording due to his writer's block and an addiction to prescription sleeping medication. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios, and Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, and Eminem handled production.\n\nRelapse is a concept album that revolves around horror, drug rehabilitation and relapse. A return of his Slim Shady alter ego, Eminem stated that the album's theme was more reminiscent of The Slim Shady LP (1999) and The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months to the production of the album. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged his rhythm to experiment with different flows. During the recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet.\n\nOne of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 608,000 copies in its first week. It also reached number one in twelve other countries. It produced four singles: "Crack a Bottle", "We Made You", "3 a.m.", and "Beautiful", as well as the promotional single: "Old Time's Sake". "Crack a Bottle", featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Relapse was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nCritically, the album received mixed reviews. Reviewers generally praised its production, but were divided in their responses towards the writing and overuse of accents throughout the album. Nonetheless, it won Eminem the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while "Crack a Bottle" won for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The album later found a strong cult following among Eminem's fans and critics, establishing Relapse as a cult classic.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter releasing Encore in 2004, Eminem planned to take some time off from recording his own music to become a hip hop producer for other rap acts, especially for the artists signed on his own label Shady Records. However, Eminem entered his hiatus after cancelling the European leg of the Anger Management Tour in the summer of 2005 because of exhaustion and an addiction to prescription sleeping drugs. In the following year, the rapper's remarriage to his former wife Kimberly Scott lasted only eleven weeks before a second divorce, while his best friend and fellow rapper Proof was later shot and killed during an altercation outside a Detroit nightclub. Devastated, Eminem relapsed into prescription drug abuse and became increasingly reclusive. In a June 2009 interview for XXL, Eminem elaborated on the impact of Proof's death on him, stating:\n\n"Everyone felt  loss, from his kids, to his wife, to everyone. But, for some reason, in hindsight, the way I felt was almost like it happened to just me... Maybe at the time I was a little bit selfish with it. I think it kind of hit me so hard. It just blindsided me. I just went into such a dark place that, with everything, the drugs, my thoughts, everything. And the more drugs I consumed, and it was all depressants I was taking, the more depressed I became, the more self-loathing I became..."\n\nSpeculation on an upcoming album by Eminem was reported since mid–2007 from announcements made by artists 50 Cent and Stat Quo, former members of Shady Records. Also, rapper Bizarre – a member of the hip hop group D12 – stated that the release of the group's third studio album was on hold because Interscope Records wanted to release Eminem's album first. By the end of the year, additional musicians associated with Shady Records – including The Alchemist, Bishop Lamont, Cashis and Obie Trice – had confirmed on different occasions that the rapper was effectively working on a new album. On September 12, 2007, during a call at the radio station WQHT Hot 97, Eminem stated that he was in limbo and was not sure whether he would release any new material in the near future. He then elaborated that at that point he was constantly working in the recording studio and had come to terms with his personal issues. However, in December 2007, he was hospitalized because of an overdose of methadone. In early 2008, he began a 12-step program to recover from his addiction; in a later interview, he said that he got sober on April 20, 2008. He has stayed sober since then.\n\nRecording\n\nEminem had continued recording throughout 2005, and released most of this work on his Shady Records compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. He also recorded the track "Beautiful" in late 2007, which would later become the fifth and final single on Relapse, and also one of the only songs on the entire album in which Eminem recorded when he wasn't sober. Eminem began the major recording stages of Relapse in mid-2008, after completing a 12-step program to control his drug addiction. Record producer and long-time Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers worked with Eminem on 25 tracks, two years after the rapper had received treatment for his sleeping pill addiction in 2005. Depressed by Proof's death, Eminem fell into a period of "writer's block", where he felt everything he wrote was not worth recording. To compensate for this, Bass chose to follow a production style that would allow the artist to rap "off the top of his head, as opposed to writing a story". Eminem would then freestyle or record vocals one line at a time before interrupting and then recording another line. At the same time, according to Eminem's song rights supervisor Joel Martin, the rapper began to collect additional songs without noticing it. He would often record or produce material initially intended for the musical projects of other artists, but end up with tracks he really liked.\n\nEminem purchased the Effigy Studio in Ferndale, Michigan, in 2007, and ended his working relationship with much of his former production team of the 54 Sound recording studio, including the Bass Brothers. In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months to the production of Relapse. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to concentrate on the processes of songwriting rather than the production, which was largely taken care of by Dre. The rapper justified his choice of using Dr. Dre for the vast majority of the production due to their long collaborative history and a musical "chemistry" only he and Dr. Dre shared. This allowed the rapper to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged him rhythm-wise to experiment with different flows. The making of the album progressed at the Effigy Studio up to a year after, as recording sessions were then moved to Orlando, Florida in September 2008. By then, Eminem had begun to start writing verses again at such a pace that he often took more time to record the lyrics than write them. He credited sobriety for his new creative run, acknowledging that his mind was free of the clutter that "blocked" him during his drug abuse in the last years. Dr. Dre would start the song-writing process by giving a number of his beats on a CD to Eminem, who in a separate room in the studio would listen and select the ones he preferred and inspired him the most. Eminem would then write lyrics to the instrumentals, while Dr. Dre and his production staff continued to create new music. Once he felt he had written lyrics for enough songs, Eminem would dedicate an entire day to record his songs to the point that he would lose his voice for the following days. At that point, the rapper would then begin to write lyrics for new songs. The process continued for the next six months and allowed Eminem to have enough material for a second album, initially called Relapse 2, which became Recovery.\n\nDuring this recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet, including an incomplete version of "Crack a Bottle". The song was finished in January 2009 and featured vocals from Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Despite the leak, the album was being completed in a state of near-total secrecy, according to the British newspaper The Independent. Even Polydor Records, the multinational owner of Interscope, had no information on the album at the time. On April 23, Eminem suggested he and possibly Dr. Dre were the only ones in possession of the final copy of Relapse; his manager Paul Rosenberg added that even Eminem's record labels were not in possession of the music less than a month before its release to prevent possible bootlegging.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nIn an interview for XXL, Eminem described the concept behind Relapse to be the ending of his drug rehabilitation and thus rap as if he was on drugs again, as well as the return of his fictional alter-ego Slim Shady. According to the interviewer Datwon Thomas, Eminem's influences for the album came from his own past drug issues and from television shows and documentaries involving crime and serial killers, as the rapper was fascinated by "serial killers and their psyche and their mind states". In a May 2009 interview for The New York Times, Eminem discussed his view of serial killers, stating:\n\n"You listen to these people talk, or you see them, they look so regular. What does a serial killer look like? He don’t look like anything. He looks like you. You could be living next door to one. If I lived next door to you, you could be."\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau interpreted the opening line to the album featuring the phrase "horror corridor" as Eminem telling listeners that it is a horrorcore album. Ben Kaplan of the Vancouver Courier also categorized it as a horrorcore album. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times said that the album's "horrorcore scenes" show Eminem as "a madman created by the hypocrisy of therapy." Music journalist Rob Sheffield remarked on its sensationalist drug references and said that Relapse is "a hip-hop version" of comedian Richard Pryor's Live on the Sunset Strip (1982).\n\nSongs\nRelapse opens with the skit "Dr. West", where actor Dominic West voices a drug counselor whose untrustworthiness causes Eminem to fall back to drugs and the return to his Slim Shady character. The skit leads to "3 A.M.", where Eminem depicts himself as a serial killer during a murder spree. When "3 A.M." was released as a single prior to the album's own release, Eminem noted that the song closely mirrored what he believed was the overall dark tone of the album. On "My Mom", the rapper traces his addictive tendencies to his mother and shows how he became a drug addict just like her. Eminem continues his family tales on "Insane", where he imagines himself as a victim of child sexual abuse. For Eminem, the goal of "Insane" was to make song that would disgust the listeners and "make them puke", adding that he came up with this idea after thinking of the song's first line ("I was born with a dick in my brain/Yeah, fucked in the head"). Mariah Carey and her then current husband Nick Cannon are targeted in "Bagpipes from Baghdad", where Eminem raps over a pungi loop.\n\nAfter "Hello", where Eminem re-introduces himself after years of being absent "mentally", he continues his violent fantasies on "Same Song & Dance", where he abducts and murders Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. The upbeat rhythm of "Same Song & Dance" reminded Eminem of a dance track, which inspired him to write something in order to "get women to dance to it and not really know what the fuck they're dancing to" without listening to the lyrics. On the ninth track of the album, "We Made You", Eminem mocks several celebrities and plays the role of a "pop star serial killer". Eminem noted that his various "celebrity bashings" were not meant to be seen as personal attacks, but it was rather "picking names out of a hat" that rhymed with the words he wanted to use during the writing process. On "Medicine Ball" Eminem mocks and impersonates deceased actor Christopher Reeve in order to get his audience to "laugh at it, and then almost feel bad for laughing". The next track is "Stay Wide Awake", which Eminem raps about assaulting and raping women. Dr. Dre also has a guest appearance on "Old Time's Sake", a duet Eminem described as a "fun, yet reminiscent record old times" in which he and Dre rap back and forth between each other, advocating the use of marijuana for creative and financial benefits. Song "Must Be the Ganja" follows, where Eminem raps that working in the recording studio is like a drug and an addiction for him.\n\nAfter the skit "Mr. Mathers", where Eminem is found unconscious in bathroom by paramedics due to a drug overdose and taken to a hospital, "Déjà Vu" addresses his overdose in 2007 and drug dependency during his hiatus from music. On the song, Eminem also explains how this has affected him in the last five years, to the point where his daughter has become scared of her father's behavior. "Beautiful", a ballad which samples "Reaching Out" by Queen + Paul Rodgers, also deals with the same time period where Eminem believed he had "reached rock bottom" and lost hope for his future. Eminem felt it was important to include "Beautiful" on the album as a reminder to himself as well as "anybody who is in a dark place  that you can get out of it". After "Crack a Bottle", a collaboration with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, Relapse ends with "Underground". On this final track, Eminem sought to bring back to his music and lyrics the subject matter and punchlines reminiscent of "The Hiphop Shop times" (The Hiphop Shop was a clothing store in Detroit where local rappers, including Eminem, would compete in freestyle battles), before he had become famous and thus did not have worry about the explicit content of his lyrics.\n\nRelapse: Refill, Relapse 2 and Recovery\n\nBecause Eminem recorded far more material than he could use for one album and felt that he had to offer his fans more music after staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem in fact had planned to put out two albums the same year, following with Relapse 2, in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." Eminem also explained the album was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill, which includes a bonus disc featuring seven new tracks, including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year."\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2", thus announcing that the album has been scrapped in favor of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result did not seem to him as continuation of Relapse but more of an individual project that deserved its own name. Eminem said: "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nIn 2007, Shady Records rapper Cashis discussed the album, referring to it by the title King Mathers and adding that it would be released later that year. However, Eminem's publicist Dennis Dennehy would later deny this and stated that "there  no album scheduled for a 2007 release" and that, as of August 2007, there was no confirmed title. No other official statement was made for over a year. It was not until September 15, 2008, at an event held by Shade 45 to celebrate the publication of Eminem's autobiography The Way I Am, the rapper confirmed his plans to release a studio album by the title of Relapse. During the party, he also previewed to the audience a song called "I'm Having a Relapse".\n\nIn regards to the album's release date, Rolling Stone wrote in its October 2008 issue that Virgin Megastores had planned to distribute Relapse on November 27, 2008 in the United States. On October 27, a spokesperson for Interscope explained that there was no official date at the time, and that any release dates that had been posted on any website were unfounded. In a phone conversation during the finale of Total Request Live on November 16, 2008, Eminem asserted that Relapse would be released during the first quarter of 2009, precisely during either of the first two months of the year, explaining that he was in the process of selecting the songs for the album.\n\nDespite the leak two months before, "Crack a Bottle" was eventually released for legal paid digital download as well as a promotional single on February 2, 2009, and also reached the number one position on the US Billboard Hot 100; according to Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg, a music video for the song had been produced and directed by Syndrome and was released in several parts of the world from May to early June. At the time of the release, various contradicting reports disputed whether the song would be included on Relapse, but a press release from head label Universal Music Group confirmed the single's inclusion on the album. In similar press statements after March 5, Universal made public the regional release dates for Relapse: as early as May 15, 2009, in Italy and the Netherlands; most other European countries and Brazil on May 18; and the following day in the United States and Australia. Additionally, the record label also announced a second album by Eminem, then called Relapse 2 but later titled Recovery, which was to be released by the end of the year, but expected in June 2010. Eminem explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, by releasing two albums, would allow listeners to have access to all of his music.\n\nAfter the release of "Crack a Bottle", the music video of the single "We Made You" was aired on April 7, and became available for purchase a week later on April 13. The video was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered simultaneously on several MTV channels as well as MTV's website. On April 28, the third overall single for the album, "3 a.m.", was released again for paid music download. A music video for "3 a.m." was directed by Syndrome and filmed in Detroit. It premiered on May 2 on Cinemax, several days after a trailer for the video was posted online. Two more singles were distributed prior to the album's release, as "Old Time's Sake" and "Beautiful" went on sale on the iTunes Store on May 5 and 12 respectively. "My Darling" and "Careful What You Wish For" were made available upon purchase of the Premium version of the album. The track "Insane" peaked at position 85 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on the album's release via iTunes.\n\nOn April 4, 2009, CBS featured Eminem during the network's coverage of the 2009 NCAA Final Four in a segment where he recited the spoken word "Love Letter to Detroit". Later on the same day, the rapper inducted the hip hop group Run-D.M.C. to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Adam Graham of The Detroit News described this as "all part of the calculated promotional push" for Relapse. The rapper performed live at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards on May 31, while he appeared on the covers of hip hop magazines Vibe and XXL in their respective issues in June 2009; the latter was created by a deal struck with Eminem and Marvel Comics, where the rapper would pose as Marvel's main vigilante The Punisher. Marvel created an issue of the comic co-starring Eminem. An iPhone game to accompany the album was released on May 19, 2009.\n\nWhile on the Never Say Never tour, fellow group members Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" stopped by KISS 100FM for a live interview and spoke on Relapse. Royce stated that the album will be a game changer and jokingly said he might have to push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't sure if they would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year".\n\nArtwork\nThe album cover for Relapse was first published through Eminem's Twitter account on April 21, 2009. It illustrates a head shot of the rapper composed by a mosaic of thousands of pills. A sticker on the cover resembles a prescription drug label, on which the patient is Eminem and the prescribing doctor is Dr. Dre. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described the cover as a reference to the rapper's struggle and addiction to prescription drugs, adding that it follows Eminem's habit of displaying personal issues in his art. The album booklet and back cover follow a pill prescription design. On the backside of the booklet is a dedication to Proof, where Eminem explains that he's sober and that he tried to write a song for him, but that he didn't find one of them good enough therefore he dedicates the whole album to him. The CD itself is meant to represent the lid on a bottle of prescription pills, grey with the big red inscription "Push Down & Turn". The cover for Relapse: Refill is the same, with the background color changed from black to white. The prescription drug label is scratched out and the writing "Refill" is posed next to it.\n\nCritical reception\n\nRelapse received a mostly mixed reception from music critics upon release. It holds an aggregate score of 59, based on 27 reviews, at Metacritic. Despite calling it an "impressively focused and clever work", Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers felt the music was "not transcendent" and commented that "Eminem could have pulled his music into a new category. What he presents is still powerful, but narrowly cast". Andy Gill of The Independent found the album to be "drably repetitive, while its dated tone is emphasised by the return of Dr Dre as producer." NME's Louis Pattison found Eminem's wordplay "wicked in the depths of its depravity", but felt that "the overriding feel is of an album just too jaded, too joyless to truly count as a return to form". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson viewed that "the further Relapse strays from narrative veracity, the more one suspects his fanbase feels he's tapping into his bottomless well for horror-show grandstanding." The Times called Relapse "an album that sits square between what Eminem is theoretically still capable of and what we feared he has become." Nathan Rabin, writing in The A.V. Club, panned it as "facile pre-adolescent shock mixed with gory, corpse-strewn, Fangoria-damaged horrorcore." MSN Music's Robert Christgau called it a "dud" and accused Eminem of sensationalism: "this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him".\n\nIn a positive review, Rolling Stone magazine's Rob Sheffield called the album a "more painful, honest and vital record" that is on-par or better than Eminem's 2002 album The Eminem Show. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as "musically white-hot, dense, and dramatic" and said that "his flow is so good, his wordplay so sharp, it seems churlish to wish that he addressed something other than his long-standing obsessions and demons". The Daily Telegraph commended its honest depiction of Eminem's drug addiction and overuse. Although he found its concept "spotty", Vibe's Benjamin Meadows-Ingram praised Eminem's lyricism, writing that "Em works wonders with words, expanding the boundaries of the art of rap itself  the composition is experimental and abstract, a master toying with form". At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nRetrospective appraisals\nDespite the lukewarm reviews at its release, the album gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of Eminem's classic albums. Mark Batson, one of the co-producers with Dr. Dre, said: "When we made Relapse with Eminem, it was not well received at the moment but now it is considered to be a classic. That’s how it goes."\n\nMitch Findlay from HotNewHipHop touted Relapse as Eminem's strongest project after The Eminem Show: "Relapse is probably the strongest of Eminem’s post-comeback catalog, largely in part to some excellent production from Dr. Dre, Dawaun Parker, and Mike Elizondo. Plus, Em seems to be in the zone here, especially when it comes to his flow. The concept, in which he embodies a depraved, accented serial killer, can be a little tiresome, but it also leads to a gratuitous bout of lyrical and hilarious Grand-Guignol." He singled out "Hello", "Beautiful" and "Deja Vu" as highlights. In 2019, Findlay included "Same Song and Dance" and "Music Box" on his "Dr. Dre's Top 10 Most Haunting Beats". Complex magazine's "The 100 Best Eminem Song" ranks "Stay Wide Awake" at number 86, "Elevator" at number 81, "My Darling" at number 79, "Underground" at number 74, "3 a.m." at number 67, "Insane" at number 27, and "Déjà Vu" at number 20.\n\nDrew Landry from DJ Booth called Relapse a "dark, disturbing and often hilarious album" and said: "Relapse sounds like a “how many violent dick jokes can I shout before someone tries to decapitate me” science experiment. If you simply sit back and embrace the depravity, though, it's oddly glorious. Eminem wasn't trying to make radio hits nor was he trying to inspire fans; he just wanted to gross us all out. And in that regard, holy shit does he succeed.". He singled out "Insane", "Stay Wide Awake", "Same Song & Dance", "Medicine Ball" and "3 a.m" as the 5 most disgusting songs on the album.\n\nPatrick Bierut from UDiscoverMusic named Relapse "the true marvel Of Eminem’s sinister return to hip-hop" and said "Relapse remains one of the most overlooked releases not only of Eminem’s career, but the mid-to-late 00s. Not only is it the Eminem album in which Dr. Dre had the truest hand in production, it’s also the most remarkable demonstration of his raw ability to rap better than almost anyone else. Due to its divisive content, however, Relapse doesn’t get enough credit for being the marvel it truly is."\n\nSpin also included some songs of the album on the top 100 of All 289 Eminem Songs, Ranked article, included "Déjà Vu" at 36 position, "Crack a Bottle" at number 48, "Beautiful" at number 62, "3 a.m" at number 68, "Elevator" at number 76, "Stay Wide Awake" at number 79 and "Underground" at number 82. HipHopDX called Relapse a "horrorcore masterpiece" and said: "the record stands as an artistic achievement that further solidifies Eminem as one of the greatest, most creative MCs to ever pick up a microphone. The article goes on to reflect the changing fan sentiment toward the album, stating that it took "years to uncover its brilliance".\n\nEminem's thoughts on the album\nOn his following album Recovery (2010), Eminem made reference to Relapse and criticizes it in the second verse of the song "Not Afraid": "In fact, let's be honest/That last Relapse CD was 'ehh'/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going back to that now".\n\nHe slowed down his feelings about the album after that saying "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That was one of those instances where I got in a zone, like, "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q&A with Rolling Stone saying "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.\n\nIn 2013, Eminem also addressed the mindstate he had while working on 2009's Relapse saying: "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I was still trying to figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." and reiterated his feeling about the album "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through to be able to make Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again."\n\nAbout the accents he used on the album: "I recorded at least 50 to 60 songs for that album and on each one I would get a little more drastic with the accents, trying to bend the words and make them rhyme in ways they wouldn’t if you just said them regular. It was this gradual thing and I didn’t even realize how accent-heavy the album got. Paul  didn’t realize it either until he went and played the music for somebody at Interscope and they were like, “Why is he doing all those accents?” So yeah, I don't know how much replay value that album has." He reitrates his statement in 2018: "I have made albums that definitely, probably would not be at the top of my list — Encore, Relapse — which I believe Encore is a better album than Relapse. Relapse is something I went back to and cringed at. Like, ‘Jesus Christ, I didn’t realize I was doing that many accents."\n\nOn his album Revival (2017), Eminem also made references to Relapse especially on the closing song "Arose": "I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse/ With Recovery, Mathers LP2/ Help propel me to victory laps/ Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past".\n\nIn 2020, Eminem looks back positively on the album for the 11th anniversary of its release. Eminem also emulates his Relapse rap style in Music to be Murdered By: Side B (Deluxe Edition) on the song "Discombobulated"\n\nCommercial performance\nOne of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse was the top-selling hip hop album of the year.

It was released on June 18, 2010, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It serves as the follow-up to  Eminem's sixth studio album Relapse. Originally planned to be released as Relapse 2, the album was renamed to Recovery when  Eminem found the album to be musically different from its predecessor.\n\nProduction of the album took place from 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios and was handled by various record producers, including Alex da Kid, Just Blaze, Boi-1da, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter, and Dr. Dre.  Eminem also collaborated with artists such as Pink, Lil Wayne, Slaughterhouse and Rihanna for the album. Recovery featured more introspective and emotional content than its predecessor and the theme of the album revolved around his positive changes, anxiety, and emotional drives.\n\nRecovery debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies. It also reached number one in 16 other countries. It spawned four singles; "Not Afraid", "Love the Way You Lie", "No Love", and "Space Bound", with the former two both reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide and the best-selling album in the US of 2010. The album received generally positive reviews by critics and was regarded as an improvement to Relapse. To promote it, Eminem performed the album's songs on televised shows, at award ceremonies, musical events and also headed The Recovery Tour.\n\nIn August 2011, Recovery was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2011 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year; the latter two were for "Love the Way You Lie". The album earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and Grammy Awards.\n\nDue to Eminem recording far more material than he could use for one album, he felt that he had to offer his fans more music. After staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem had in fact planned to put out two albums that year, following with Relapse 2 in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." Eminem also explained that the album was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill, which includes a bonus disc featuring seven new tracks, including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. During the recording process of the album, Eminem stated that "The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff  to be heard". On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2", thus announcing that the album had been scrapped in favour of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result appeared to be more of an individual project that deserved its own name, other than a continuation of Relapse. Eminem said: "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title. The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nThe track 'Insult to Injury' would have been the leading track according to The Alchemist the producer of the track. 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' featuring D12 was a track that leaked that was recorded around early 2010 and style was more close to Recovery than Relapse. Cocaine featuring Jazmine Sullivan also leaked but it wasn't confirmand if it was for Relapse 2 or Recovery also recorded in 2010. 'Nut Up' was a leaked song from when Eminem was recording in Hawaii. 'Things Get Worse' was originally recorded in 2009 and was a solo track before Eminem and B.o.B collaborated for B.o.B's Greatest Hits album. On the track "Zeus" of Music To Be Murdered By, Eminem apologizes to Rihanna over a leaked version of 'Things Get Worse' in which he sided with Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault involving her in 2009. A song of unknown title featuring 50 Cent and two songs lead by Mr. Porter was also expected.\n\nAll the songs from Relapse: Refill were going to be part of Relapse 2. The songs "On Fire", "So Bad" and "Ridaz" from Recovery were recorded in the same sessions in Hawaii which lead to speculation that they could have been intended for Relapse 2. Although after the release of Relapse: Refill it is possible that Eminem had already moved on to Recovery.\n\nThe album was dedicated "To anyone who's in a dark place tryin' to get out. Keep your head up... It does get better! Eminem told Billboard that he was in "full-blown addiction" while recording Encore. He felt happier and "first got sober" during the recording of Relapse, having overcome his addiction. While recording Relapse, he admitted that he had not been "paying attention to what the average listener might like or not like." Just Blaze, the first producer of the album said, " already knew what sort of mistakes he has made with the previous album and where he wanted to go from there." Thus, Recovery was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records. In contrast to Eminem's previous work, the album features no skits, and downplays his Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nThe album's artwork featured two covers: One with Eminem walking down a country road and another with him sitting in a transparent living room in the middle of Detroit with the Renaissance Center in the background. The album's liner featured pictures of Eminem such as a picture of him praying and him posing without a shirt on.\n\nThe record opens with "Cold Wind Blows" in which Eminem discusses his "doomed love for his ex-wife" and about "settling scores with rival celebs. In "Talkin' 2 Myself", he states the harm caused to his image with lyrics such as: "Encore' I was on drugs, 'Relapse' I was flushing them out. "On Fire" is about "a murder-and-dismemberment fantasy" and "Won't Back Down", which featured Pink, was a rap-rock song. The singing to "W.T.P." ("White-Trash Party") is considered similar to his early records with a lighter and simple rhythmic frame. "Going Through Changes", which samples Black Sabbath's "Changes", depicts Eminem's sorrow and shows himself trapped within fame. "Not Afraid", a mid-tempo song, focuses on personal changes in Eminem, including an end to drug abuse, feuds and violence.\n\nIdolator commented that the song was based on the "dark days Eminem has lived through," and "he seems to be at peace with himself now. A writer for MuchMusic website noted that Eminem chose to use his Marshall Mathers ego for the song, rather than Slim Shady.\n\n"No Love" features Lil Wayne as a hype man. Eminem's verses follow Lil Wayne, and according to Sam Wolfson of NME were "the best verses of his career. The meaning of "Space Bound" is deemed ambiguous and according to Sasha Grey who is featured in its video, the meaning can be interpreted "in many ways. Jim Jonsin of MTV spoke about Eminem's two egos seen in the video and compared it to Alanis Morissette's "Ironic" video while Grey believed that the alternate Eminem who appears in the car is his subconscious.\n\n"Cinderella Man" has a "festive beat" and "the template of every album since Encore (2004)," with many minor keys and traces of post-grunge rock. "25 to Life" shows his discomfiture and depicts that the "selfish bitch" pulling him back "these days is rap itself. Despite the lyrics being tighter throughout the album, "So Bad" and "Almost Famous" view the other side of Slim Shady; his alter ego. The hip-hop ballad "Love The Way You Lie", which features Rihanna, describes a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. Rihanna sings the chorus, backed by an electric guitar and a piano, while acoustic guitar, violin and drums accompany Eminem's verses. Rihanna's singing expresses "grief and regret" throughout the song.\n\nTo promote the album, Eminem released a freestyle titled "Despicable" about "Over" by Drake and "Beamer, Benz, or Bentley" by Lloyd Banks featuring Juelz Santana to promote the first single, "Not Afraid", which debuted on Shade 45 on April 29. Recovery was released on June 18 in Europe and on June 21 in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nEminem promoted the album throughout its initial release, doing interviews for brands like Red Bull. A commercial for Recovery premiered during Game 6 of the 2010 NBA Finals. It featured Vince Offer doing a parody of his Slap Chop commercials. There was a Call of Duty: Black Ops ad underscored by "Won't Back Down"; the song also appeared in the game as an easter egg.\n\nOn June 15, Eminem appeared among other artists including Usher and will.i.am for Activision's press conference during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 with Rihanna where the duo performed "Love the Way You Lie". In addition, Eminem performed "Lose Yourself", "Not Afraid", and premiered "Won't Back Down" for the first time. Eminem was featured on E! during their Daily 10 show in an interview with Clinton Sparks and also appeared in a skit on The Soup. He performed songs from the album as well as his previous songs at various events such as the 2010 BET Awards, 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010, Bonnaroo Music Festival, T in the Park and Virgin Group's V Festival.

Michael Menachem from Billboard commented that "Rihanna's chorus is exquisitely melodic and surprisingly hopeful, complementing the turmoil of Em's dark, introspective rant. The song was performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and was voted the best performer of the ceremony in an MTV poll, earning 34 percent of votes.\n\n"No Love", which features American rapper Lil Wayne, was the third single released on October 5, 2010.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on 28 reviews. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised Eminem's performance as potent and energetic, and said that the album "may be flawed ... but he hasn't sounded this unfiltered and proud since The Marshall Mathers LP". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph commended him for addressing more mature, introspective subject matter and successfully "framing his misogyny, homophobia and all-round bigotry with an undeniable sense of empathy and humanity. Jody Rosen, writing in Rolling Stone, called it Eminem's "most casual-sounding album in years" and said that he "sounds content to be rap's wittiest head case.\n\nSam Wolfson of NME called him "self-aware, technically advanced, intelligent, able to go at speeds other than full throttle. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club stated that his lively raps make up for the "endless atonement metaphors" that occasionally weigh down the album. Kitty Empire, writing in The Observer, said that it is "better than average" as a "latterday Eminem album" that shows, "in bursts, Eminem's health is very nearly rude." MSN Music's Robert Christgau said that, although the cleverness "varies" and the themes are "rarely" upheld by his "long-recessive sense of play", the album is a comeback "for Eminem, not Slim Shady—and for Marshall at his most martial. His most confessional as well.\n\nIn a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times regarded Eminem as "frustratingly limited in his topical range" and called Recovery "the most insular of all his releases. Andy Gill of The Independent commented that "there's nothing here quite as witty or engaging as" on his previous work. In a largely negative review, Pitchfork's Jayson Greene perceived a lack of lyrical depth and wrote "for the first time in his career, he actually sounds clumsy. Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot criticized the writing, and said that it lacks hooks and fun: "The subversive humor is long gone, and his cultural references ... remain dated. Slant Magazine's M. T. Richards also found Eminem's pop culture references "inane" and called the album's material "unsurprisingly hollow" with punchlines that "rarely resonate. Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss found his rhyme schemes "dazzling" and wordplay "clever", but panned its production as "monochromatic and monotonous. The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said that the music lacks consistency because of a "piecemeal approach to production" and "fashionable soft-rock samples.\n\nRecovery was ranked 93rd on the Billboard Top 200 Albums of All-Time.\n\nIn 2010, Eminem was nominated for two American Music Awards Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album which he Won it and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.

83	4	Kamikaze	2018-08-31	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/bf74fc764097630ba58782ae79cfbee6/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Kamikaze (stylized as KAMIKAZƎ) is the tenth studio album by American rapper  Eminem, released on August 31, 2018, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records, and without prior announcement. The album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon. Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production for individual tracks comes from a variety of musicians.\n\nFollowing the polarizing reception of his previous album, Revival, music journalists debated over whether the rapper's relevance and ability were waning. In response to the criticism, Eminem released a remix of the song "Chloraseptic" in January 2018 with 2 Chainz and Phresher. Kamikaze represents a continuation of this response, containing various insults against critics and rappers alike. The artwork is an homage to Beastie Boys' debut album, Licensed to Ill.\n\nKamikaze received generally mixed reviews from critics. Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's previous album and a welcome return to the sound of his earlier, more aggressive material, while others criticized its lack of adaption to the current sound of hip-hop and, as a result, found it outdated. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks about various artists, as well as spurring accusations of homophobia.\n\nThe album was promoted with three singles: "Fall", "Venom", from the 2018 movie of the same name, and "Lucky You", and a music video for "Good Guy", along with a supporting tour. Commercially, the album reached number one in 18 countries, becoming Eminem's ninth consecutive number-one album in the United States, and later becoming the best-selling hip-hop album of 2018. It later received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nRecording and release\nOn January 8, 2018, Eminem unexpectedly released a remix to his Revival song, "Chloraseptic", featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher. In the song, Eminem mocked critics of Revival, concluding "I just added to the fuel in my rocket pack, till I'm ready to respond then I'ma launch it at 'em... I'll be back..." On January 22, 2018, photos revealed Mike Will Made-It in the studio with Eminem and Dr. Dre. During the Revival sessions, S1 tried to work with Eminem but he refused; the producer kept sending him beats to use on future tracks that the rapper incorporated into Kamikaze songs. The afternoon before Kamikaze's release, Eminem posted a 15-second teaser of a new song on social media, featuring the logo for the superhero film Venom, without comment.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, he released the album to digital music stores and streaming services without any promotion or pre-announcement, unlike the extensive marketing done for Revival; he would repeat the strategy with 2020's Music to Be Murdered By. Billboard credits the success of the surprise release to Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album released in December 2013 without any promotion or pre-announcement, which was a critical and commercial success, ultimately changing the global release day for music from Tuesday to Friday. The album was sold on his website in several formats, including bundled with merchandise such as apparel. Eminem used social media services such as Instagram and Twitter to announce the release and relied on extensive feedback from diss tracks and Internet hype to spread the word about the album. Several weeks after the album's release and subsequent commercial success, Eminem took out a full-page ad in The Hollywood Reporter mocking negative reviews of Kamikaze, including The Hollywood Reporter's review itself.\n\nAlthough he had no marketing prior to the debut, Eminem had previously debuted freestyle rap "The Storm" at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards using similar lyrics to the eventual title track and he directly referred to his experience performing it on "The Ringer". He debuted a clothing line featuring "The Kamikaze" t-shirt the month prior. Producer Illa da Producer sees the album as similar to The Slim Shady LP in terms of its ferocity, rather than the subdued Revival.\n\nAmerican singer Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, whose vocals were uncredited on the song "Fall", disavowed his participation in the album, claiming that he was not in the studio when the recording was made. A music video for "Fall" was released on September 4, 2018, addressing criticism of Revival. The music video was directed by James Larese, who previously directed the music videos of "Framed" and "Caterpillar". A second video was released for "Lucky You" on September 13, 2018, followed by one for "Venom" on October 5, 2018, as well as one for "Good Guy" on December 7, 2018.\n\nArtwork\n\nThe full album cover, front to back, features fighter pilot LT. Mathers III intentionally crashing an F-86 Sabre fighter jet into an unknown object. The artwork appropriates the cover design of the 1986 Beastie Boys album, Licensed to Ill; Eminem has cited them as an inspiration for several years but did not give the band any prior consultation for the cover homage. Promotion for the album featured the same artwork in full, including the Eminem logo with added Japanese writing, neither of which was included on the album cover design made by Mike Saputo.\n\nPromotion for the album track "Venom" featured the logo from the film of the same name. The "E" in "VENOM" was replaced with the "Ǝ" character Eminem frequently uses in his artwork.\n\nCritical reception\n\nKamikaze was met with favorable reviews from critics noted at review aggregator Metacritic. This release received a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album 5.6 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Album of the Year assessed it as a 58 out of 100, ranking #714 out of 744 albums. Other assessments of the critical consensus have been mixed.\n\nAja Romano of Vox called the album Eminem's best in years, citing a return to the rapper's old-school sound after deviating with Revival. Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also compared this album to Revival, calling Kamikaze a "high-kicking, low-punching riposte", indicating it is a better release. Similarly, A. D. Amorosi of Variety sees the album as similar to Eminem's earlier work, stating, "his voice hasn't sounded quite so cranky, silly, impassioned or enraged since his early days" and for XXL, Scott Glaysher calls the album a revisit of the Slim Shady persona. For Consequence of Sound, Dedrick Hendrix gave the album a B−, summing up, "As a whole, the album may not be impeccable, but it’s the best he's released since 2010." M. Oliver of PopMatters summed up his review, "Kamikaze is Slim Shady at his midlife best; slightly less deviant, not quite as funny—but revived, nonetheless" and gave the album seven out of 10. Kitty Empire wrote for The Observer that Eminem is in "full rabid underdog mode" at a time when hip hop MCs are more relaxed, giving the album three out of five stars. At HipHopDX, Trent Clark gave the album a 3.9 out of five, contrasting the work with Revival and denying this is a return to form, summing up, "After being faced with nothing to prove as the highest-selling rapper of all-time, Eminem’s found another challenge in perfecting the new style he’s put on display". Writing for Vice, Robert Christgau regarded the album as being "about hip-hop, his truest passion and sole area of undeniable expertise, rather than the larger emotional and political themes of what he conceived as a groundbreaking statement of principle ". In The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber addresses both comparisons with Revival and current hip hop stars on Kamikaze stating, "Really, though, Eminem is waging a war over aesthetics, and Kamikaze is a better listen than Revival because its concision confirms Eminem's value as an entertainer... Certainly, it's refreshing that in a genre especially obsessed with statements of dominance, Eminem doesn't disguise his feelings of irrelevance. He does, however, try to claim his influence." He added that the album shows that "Eminem is great at what he does." For Uproxx, Aaron Williams also praised the rapper's technical abilities and pointed out the function of engaging with his critics that this music performs.\n\nIn a more critical review, Stephen Kearse of Rolling Stone gave the album 2.5 out of five stars, situating Eminem in contemporary hip hop by writing, "Eminem has no insights or ideas about the state of rap, nor does he have meaningful thoughts about his place within the genre. He probably doesn’t even have a Spotify account. He raps only for the sheer thrill of hearing himself rap." The Hollywood Reporter's Jonny Coleman considered the album an "epic fail" and described it as "the work of an aging artist trying, and failing, to remain relevant by acting out." In Billboard, Charles Holmes said Eminem "tries to stop  artistic decline by blaming everyone except himself," and concluded, "Eminem was once a titan of hip-hop, but he never owned it  The world and rap might not need Eminem or Slim Shady anymore, but it could do with a little more Marshall." In The New Zealand Herald, Siena Yates praised Eminem for "technically flawless flows and cheeky wordplay" as well as "a thrilling command of cadence" but gave the album three out of five stars because "He's just not saying much and what he is saying smacks of ignorance and someone reaching for relevance in a world he's hellbent on rejecting. It's not fun, informative, challenging or entertaining, it's just a lot of technical skill and angry fist-shaking." The Guardian's Alexis Petridis gave the album three out of five stars and commented on Eminem's generational difference with current hip hop stars, summing up, "...if you're going to listen to a middle-aged white man complain that hip-hop isn't as good as it used to be, that  it might as well be Eminem."\n\nExclaim!'s Riley Wallace cited the anger of Eminem's early work, unnecessary homophobia, and the shortcomings of Revival in a middling review of 6/10: "Angry, reactionary Em is nothing new. Though his skill is absolutely unmatched, homophobic references and overly misogynistic bars in 2018 do feel excessively out of touch. It's not his best or his worst—but, it's definitely what fans deserved eight months ago." For Pitchfork, Marc Hogan gave the album five out of 10, writing, " career has become an exhausting feedback loop, and Kamikaze flies straight into that downward spiral", criticizing it as "yet another empty, intermittently tone-deaf onslaught of technical rap prowess and humorless juvenilia from an artist who once controlled the zeitgeist with ease" but praising his technical skills as a rapper and clever lyricist. In NME, Dan Stubbs gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Eminem is out of step with trends in hip-hop by writing, "there's a sense Eminem struggles with the modern world" but stating that "there are plenty of moments... that remind us of Em's greatness". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic also emphasized Eminem's technical ability and lack of inspiration: "As sheer performance, Eminem's vocals remain a thing of wonder, which is why it's so dispiriting to hear him circling the drain, relying on old tricks instead of expanding his worldview. He has the musical skills to mature; he's just refusing to let himself act his age." In Spin, Jesse Fairfax criticized the tenor of the album, writing "Eminem's defensiveness seems to preclude whatever reckoning he could otherwise have with any creative shortcomings that may have led him here". NPR's Rodney Carmichael suggested that the album is a parody writing, " may be going out with a cliché bang on Kamikaze, but he hasn't sounded more like himself in years", summing up his review with the critique, "Kamikaze may not be a success on the surface. But Eminem has inadvertently succeeded at making himself the butt of his biggest joke yet. It's so funny he forgot to laugh."\n\nCommercial performance\nIn the United States, Kamikaze opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 434,000 album-equivalent units, consisting of 252,000 traditional album sales as well as 225 million streams, giving Eminem his largest amount of streams within a week. This put him in the top ten for the highest first-week sales of 2018. It became his ninth consecutive number-one album in the country, tying him with Garth Brooks and The Rolling Stones for fifth-most entries to top the chart, and had the year's fifth-highest first-week sales in the USA. He also topped the Artist 100 chart due to album sales and song streams. The album dropped one place to number two in its second week behind Paul McCartney's Egypt Station, earning an additional 136,000 album-equivalent units. All eleven songs entered the Billboard Hot 100, with "Lucky You" and "The Ringer" reaching numbers six and eight on the chart. He is the fifth artist to debut two songs in its top 10 simultaneously. By October 17, it was the best-selling hip-hop album of the year, and a few days later, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with 1 million album-equivalent units in the United States; 415,000 of them being pure sales.\n\nThe album also entered atop the UK Albums Chart on September 7, with first-week sales of 55,000 album-equivalent units, including 30,000 album-equivalent streams, making Kamikaze the United Kingdom's fifth-most streamed album in an opening week. As a result, Eminem surpassed Led Zeppelin and ABBA for the most consecutive albums to reach the nation's summit, with nine. It was also the top album in Scotland. The following week, the album retained the top spot, with 51% of its consumption coming from streams, and garnered 29,000 units for the third week to stay at number one. It managed to stay atop the charts for four weeks. It was the 10th best-selling album of 2018 in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt additionally debuted at the top of the ARIA Albums Chart, giving Eminem his ninth number-one album in Australia (where it stayed for four weeks) and on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming Eminem's 10th number-one album in Canada after debuting with 44,000 album-equivalent units. Other international charts that it topped include Austria, Belgium (Flanders only; it reached third in Wallonia), the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland; it retained the top spot in Ireland the following two weeks. Kamikaze debuted sixth in France, fourth in Germany, tenth in Greece, eighth in Hungary, third in Poland, and fifteenth in Spain; after one week, it rose to second in Germany, and twelfth in Spain.\n\nOn streaming music service Spotify, five tracks from Kamikaze were in the top 10 of the week of September 4, including the top two spots. At the iTunes Store, three songs were in the top ten and Kamikaze topped the album charts in the first week of release. The album had the fifth-strongest opening week for streaming in the United Kingdom with 30,000 equivalent units. "Lucky You" represents the first time that Eminem has topped the Streaming Songs Chart from Billboard.\n\nIn 2018, Kamikaze was ranked as the 17th most popular album of the year on the Billboard 200, and by the end of the year Kamikaze had sold over 1,014,000 album-equivalent units in the US, with over 457,000 being pure sales. As of January 2019, Kamikaze has sold over 500,000 copies in pure sales, making it the only solo album of 2018 to do so. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, Kamikaze was the ninth best-selling album globally in 2018, with 1 million physical and digital copies sold.\n\nControversy\n\nThroughout the album, lyrics criticize other musicians and several have responded publicly. Eminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to "Not Alike" titled "Rap Devil" on September 3; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it "a battle between the past and the fucking future". The song's title refers to Eminem's "Rap God" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre. Eminem responded with "Killshot" on September 14 and Bizarre's "Love Tap" was released on September 20. "Killshot" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip-hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform's history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem's 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.\n\nJa Rule responded on social media, re-igniting a feud the two had 15 years prior. 6ix9ine, Iggy Azalea, Joe Budden, Die Antwoord, Lupe Fiasco, and Lord Jamar have also responded publicly, with the first releasing the skit "Legend" that raps over Eminem's "Lose Yourself". Artists including 50 Cent and Remy Ma have come out in support of Eminem.\n\nMusicians have criticized Eminem's use of the slur "faggot" to describe rapper Tyler, the Creator on the song "Fall", including Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons, calling the rapper's language "hateful", and Troye Sivan; additionally, guest vocalist Justin Vernon distanced himself from the collaboration due to the message. Critics have also objected to the slur, such as Mikelle Street of Billboard, who wrote, "Eminem needs to be held accountable for using homophobic slurs (again)," further adding, "the idea that listeners are too 'soft' for critiquing the ways in which rappers weaponize the identities of others against them ignores how hip-hop is a reflection and arbiter of culture." Matt Miller of Esquire relates his use of the term to previous homophobic lyrics and calls it the "biggest problem" of the album. The BBC's Jimmy Blake summed up the first week of objections to Eminem's language and questioned if it is time for him to retire. Eminem later apologized in his "Kamikaze Interview" with Sway Calloway posted to his website: "In my quest to hurt him, I realize I was hurting a lot of other people".\n\nIn response to allegations that "Not Alike" sounds similar to Bhad Bhabie's "Hi Bich", Bhabie has responded that she takes the comparison as a compliment. She revised the lyrics of 15 to pay respect to Eminem.	f
84	4	The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Deluxe)	2013-11-05	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/b6938db3addc3ccd9575d6d12220e466/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	The Marshall Mathers LP 2 is the eighth studio album by American rapper  Eminem. It was released on November 5, 2013, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It serves as a sequel to his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). Recorded from 2012 to 2013 with several producers, Dr. Dre and Rick Rubin served as executive producers for The Marshall Mathers LP 2. It features guest appearances from Skylar Grey, Rihanna, Nate Ruess, and rapper Kendrick Lamar, among others.\n\nThe idea of a sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP came about after  Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him of his earlier music, though  Eminem wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds from turntablism for the sequel. The album draws influences from arena rock and old-school hip hop, mainly inspired by the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill era and LL Cool J's Radio era, while the production is more minimalist than  Eminem's previous records.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 was regarded as one of the most anticipated albums of 2013. The album was revealed during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August 2013, alongside a preview of its lead single "Berzerk". It was followed by two more singles: "Survival" and "Rap God". "The Monster", featuring Rihanna, was released as the album's fourth single and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's fifth single "Headlights", featuring Ruess, was released in 2014.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling more than 792,000 copies in its first week. In March 2017, it was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was met with positive reviews by critics, with praise directed at Eminem's technical rapping abilities and production choices. The album marked an improvement in a reception over Eminem's previous three albums, and was named on multiple best album year-end lists. It won Eminem a record sixth Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2015 Grammy Awards.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, Eminem revealed that he was working on his next album, during an interview on Hot 97's morning show with Peter Rosenberg. On June 30, 2012, Eminem talked about the album with DJ Whoo Kid, on his own radio station, Shade 45. He stated that the material was taking shape, and that Dr. Dre would be involved in some way. Eminem explained: "I usually get going and kind of start going a certain direction and just record what I'm feeling. Then I'll go see Dre and fill in some of those pieces."\n\nOn August 1, 2012, Nick Craig interviewed Eminem on Channel 95.5, where he explained that he was working on the album, but was focused on finishing Slaughterhouse's Shady Records debut Welcome to: Our House, On August 10 however, Eminem appeared on Shade 45 and told Sway Calloway: "We actually just finished the  album last week ... Now I've got time to be able to start doing things for my own project." Royce da 5'9" appeared on MTV's RapFix, hosted by Calloway, with his group Slaughterhouse, on August 30, 2012, and talked about Eminem's album. Royce confessed: "Marshall is the studio right now, laying the most awesome lyrics in the world. I'm not so sure how the world is going to respond from some of the things that I've heard from him."\n\nOn February 8, 2013, Shady Records president and Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg told Billboard that Eminem's eighth studio album would be released after Memorial Day, 2013 (May 27). "We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's been working on it for some time," said Rosenberg. "It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up." On March 22, 2013, during an interview with Power 106, Dr. Dre said that he was working with Eminem, and that Eminem was "finishing up his project."\n\nOn June 17, 2013, Shady Records producer The Alchemist appeared on RapFix Live, and tweeted to shadygodz (One of the Stan fans aka Sanket Kale Mathers) about Eminem's upcoming album: "That's my boss. I DJ for him and I'm not at liberty to speak on much, but you know his caliber and what he does. Clearly going to further territories. I think what you would expect, especially after the last go-round. He was just getting his feet back on Relapse and then Recovery just came with the smash hits and everything and I think now — he's Eminem." Prior to the announcement of the album's name, it was named to multiple "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" lists; including MTV, Complex where it was listed in sixth position (and later on in second); and XXL, where it was listed in fifth.\n\nOn June 17, 2013, producer S1 told Hip Hop Weekly: "I've been working on Eminem's new album and I'm very excited about that." The track list reveal showed "Bad Guy" as the opening track, and S1 confirmed that he and vocalist Sarah Jaffe, one half of S1's duo The Dividends, are featured on the song. He also credited Aussie M-Phazes and Streetrunner as co-producers. M-Phazes himself confirmed this in an October 2013 interview.\n\nTim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision Blizzard, explained to Billboard in August 2013 that he was contacted by Eminem's manager Rosenberg in March to partner Eminem with Call of Duty: Ghosts. In June, Riley and members of his team flew to Detroit to meet Eminem and Rosenberg. The team was showcased a "handful" of songs, while Eminem was shown early concept art and gameplay footage of Ghosts. "Survival" was picked as the best-fitting song, but the final version differed vastly from the earliest version of the track. Over the next couple of months, Eminem turned in five successive versions of the song, each one "bigger and more anthemic sounding than the last." – The final version was turned in only a day before its reveal on August 14.\n\nIn a behind the scenes video for "Berzerk", released in October 2013, Rubin explained that he met Rosenberg a few years back and that they had discussed the possibility of him and Eminem working together. He stated that the idea of "throwback" song to earlier hip hop recordings was an idea conceived later in the creative process of the album. He noted that initial sample the song was built around ended up not being used, and that the final product differs greatly from the original. In an October 2013 interview with MTV, DVLP said that the instrumental for "Rap God" had been in the making two years prior to the track's release. While the instrumental had been offered to rappers such as T.I. and Fabolous, the producer didn't feel the record fit their music. He estimated that Shady Records got hold of the instrumental around Fall 2012, and DVLP himself did not hear "Rap God" until Eminem phoned him after its release.\n\nThe idea of a sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP came about after Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him and his friends, namely Rosenberg, of Eminem's earlier recordings; " The more I listened to it, the more it made sense to call it that," said Eminem. Eminem also wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds such as beatbreaks and scratches, and he felt that Rubin could help him "take that to another level."\n\nRihanna, with whom Eminem previously collaborated on "Love the Way You Lie" from Eminem's previous studio effort, Recovery (2010), was featured on the song "The Monster". On September 11, 2013, she hinted at the collaboration on Twitter: "Just left the studio ... Recorded a #monster hook for one of my favorite artists! And that's all I can give you ... #NavyShit". Upon the track list announcement, Staten Island singer Bebe Rexha revealed on Twitter that she had co-written the Rihanna collaboration featured on the album. Rexha recorded "The Monster" in November 2012 in Harlem's Stadium Red studio while working on her debut album. The producer of the track, Frequency, auditioned records for Shady Records VP of A&R Riggs Morales, who "freaked out" upon hearing "The Monster", instantly requesting for the verses to be stripped and Pro Tools sessions sent to Eminem. Eminem added his own verses and tweaked the instrumental, while keeping Rexha's backing vocals. The song was revealed to be a part of the album with the reveal of the track listing. In an October 2013 interview, Rexha claimed that she said "This is an Eminem record, y'all" while standing in the booth after she recorded the chorus, and that she "know when  heard it, it spoke to him."\n\nRapper and fellow Aftermath Entertainment artist Kendrick Lamar, who toured with Eminem in 2013, was featured on "Love Game", while indie pop band Fun. frontman Nate Ruess was featured on "Headlights".\n\nSkylar Grey, a frequent Eminem collaborator since Recovery was featured on the song "Asshole". In an October 2013 interview with American Songwriter, "Love the Way You Lie" producer Alex da Kid revealed that he has submitted further beats for Eminem, but said "you never know what they're going to use or not going to use." He would later be confirmed as the producer of "Asshole" and two of the deluxe edition bonus tracks. "Asshole" was initially created during a studio session with Alex and Eminem in Detroit in 2012. Grey was writing songs for her Eminem-executive-produced album Don't Look Down in Detroit, and visited Eminem to exchange song ideas and hooks. She wrote the hook for "Asshole" during the trip, while in her hotel room.\n\n"Legacy" was written approximately two years ago during a session between Russian singer-songwriter Polina and songwriter David Brook in New York. A few months later, Polina visited Interscope executive Neil Jacobson, who, upon hearing the song, commanded her: "Don't play this for anyone. It's an Eminem record." The following week, Polina and Brook joined Emile in the studio where he produced the song and then sent it to Eminem. Eminem added his own verses to the song, but left Polina's vocals untouched.\n\nIn July 2012, Eminem's close friend and label-mate 50 Cent stated that he was involved in the recording for Eminem's upcoming album and would probably appear on the lead or second single, but ended up not being featured on the album at all.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 33 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."\n\nPaul MacInnes of The Guardian gave the album a perfect five star rating saying, "His flows are exceptional, the wordplay is dazzling. The jokes, in places offensive, are relentless. There is no apology; no concession; just a virtuoso application of talent." Jon Dolan of the Rolling Stone said, "Nostalgia is everywhere. … He's playing his best character, the demon spawn of Trailer Hell, America, hitting middle age with his middle finger up his nose while he cleans off the Kool-Aid his kids spilled on the couch". Christopher Weingarten of Spin stated, "If rapping were purely an athletic competition, Eminem would be Michael Phelps and Lou Retton combined: pure ability and flexibility, like a bullet with only white-hot hate in his wake". He would go on to add that "we get rhymes… more rhymes than some rappers manage in a whole career". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said, "Eminem sounds more alive – angrier yet fully present – than he has in years… Eminem burns with purpose on "MMLP2". And if you don't like what he (still) has to say, there's a chance he doesn't either".\n\nEdna Gundersen of USA Today said, Eminem "recaptures the original release's wild, clever, emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review saying, "If anything, the sequel is more intense than the original, as the Detroit rapper explodes like an M-80..... many memorable ones to be heard here, as Eminem doubles down on his manic flow, bursting with analogies, jokes, illusions, and ingenious wordplay with dizzying speed and skill". Dan Rys of XXL gave the album a rating of XL saying, "the thing that carries Em through is the diversity of his flows, and his ability to rap over anything ..... you're getting one with more perspective, a version which has seen 13 more years and has a different outlook on some of the same topics that he first visited in 2000". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album a B rating, saying "after years of stagnancy and tedious anger, he shows real growth on The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem has always rapped with forceful determination out of compulsive drives to prove himself to doubters, cut down his enemies, and retain his commercial foothold. For the first time in far too long, he sounds like he's rapping because he enjoys it, too." Jon Carmanica of The New York Times gave the album a positive review saying, "His lyrics are best viewed under a microscope..... to see how he gets from one rhyme to the next in unexpected ways..... he'll dominate almost any sound..... but he still has some old habits, still heavy-handed with homophobic slurs..... Eminem is still rapping from deep inside his cave, as if he's had no new experiences to draw from." David Jeffries of AllMusic spoke of the album saying, it is a "vicious, infectious, hilarious triumph..... a super villain so familiar with hate and depression, he's powered by all shades of anger ..... most of the best moments on MMLP2 are just as angry and just as irresponsible..... Eminem at his very best." Luke Fox of Exclaim! gave the album an eight out ten rating praising the albums "astounding wordplay and creative beat choices".\n\nIn a mixed review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave the album two out of four stars saying, "it reaffirms his prodigious agility with rhymes. Eminem still crunches together syllables, silliness, and storytelling flights of ridiculousness with acrobatic skill" and "The sense that we've all been here before, twice, is exacerbated by tired samples and interpolations. Eminem tries to cover up his retreat by doing cartwheels and back-flips with his rhymes". Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork gave the album a mixed review saying, "Eminem is a titan with wordplay, but MMLP2 once again finds him at a loss for how to apply his talents." Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C+ criticizing Eminem's use of slurs on the album, saying "Eminem wouldn't be Eminem..... if he didn't allot some of his whizbang homophobic slurs and misogynistic fantasies..... rightly considered a rap great for his technical prowess, wicked humor, and tenacity..... which make his flashes of hatred for women and gay men all the more alarming."	f
85	4	The Slim Shady LP (Expanded Edition)	2019-02-22	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/97c9e512907536e3f45d8c22f63d6a2b/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	"The Slim Shady LP" is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rapper  Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following  Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and  Eminem himself.\n\nFeaturing West Coast hip-hop, G-funk, and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of  Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the "Slim Shady EP". "The Slim Shady LP" contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which  Eminem referred to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff," describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations with living in poverty.\n\n"The Slim Shady LP" debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's "FanMail", and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, "My Name Is", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, "The Slim Shady LP" was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nWhile the success of "The Slim Shady LP" turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album's success was vital in breaking the stereotype that "white people cannot rap", and has since been included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time. Spin later included it in their list of "The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014".\n\nBackground\n\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album "Infinite", which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. "Infinite" achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it." Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, "I don't give a fuck if you're purple. If you can kick it, I'm working with you." Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\nRecording\n\n"The Slim Shady LP" was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished "My Name Is" in an hour. Three other songs, including "Role Model", were also recorded that day.\n\n"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", which was formerly featured on the "Slim Shady EP" as "Just the Two of Us", was re-recorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." Eminem also said, "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." The song "Guilty Conscience" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre "fell out of his chair laughing" upon hearing the lyric.\n\n"Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in "The Marshall Mathers LP 2". Another skit, "Bitch", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album. During the mixing process of "The Slim Shady LP", at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, "Devil Without a Cause"; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem's song "My Fault", which appears on "The Slim Shady LP"; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song "Fuck Off" for Devil Without a Cause.\n\nProduction\n\nThe album's production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that "The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play." According to the staff at IGN, "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" is backed by the "lulling serenity of a super silky groove". "Cum on Everybody"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while "My Name Is", which is built around a sample from British musician Labi Siffre's "I Got The", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. "I'm Shady" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield's "Pusherman" in Ice-T's song "I'm Your Pusher", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use "Pusherman".\n\nEminem's vocal inflection on the album has been described as a "nasal whine"; Jon Pareles of The New York Times likened his "calmly sarcastic delivery" to "the early Beastie Boys turned cynical". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to "Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent". A skit entitled "Lounge" appears before "My Fault" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line "I never meant to give you mushrooms" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write "My Fault".\n\nLyrical Themes\n\nMany of the songs from "The Slim Shady LP" are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, "I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word "nigga" on the album, noting, "It's not in my vocabulary." "The Slim Shady LP" begins with a "Public Service Announcement" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled "Paul" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to "tone down" his lyrics.\n\n"Guilty Conscience" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the "angel" and "devil" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in "Guilty Conscience", the outcome is unclear. On "My Fault", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an epilogue to the song "Kim", although "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic explained that "There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words." On the song "Brain Damage", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school, particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully.\n\nAlthough many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing "The Slim Shady LP", Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks." Eminem was inspired to write "Rock Bottom" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished." "If I Had" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the "white trash" stereotype.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album was met with critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's "expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination", adding that "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music." David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's "unapologetic outrageousness" as a reaction to the "soul positivity" of conscious hip hop, noting that "The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch." Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" but lamented the "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem."\n\nMany reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, "Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that "the wife-killing jokes of "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is "sophomoric and uninspired" at times, Eminem's "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." Mike Rubin of Spin noted that "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are." Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1999, Robert Christgau called the record a "platinum-bound cause celebre" and, despite succumbing to "dull sensationalism" toward the end, Eminem shows "more comic genius than any pop musician since", possibly, Loudon Wainwright III."\n\nAccolades\n\nAt the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. Rolling Stone ranked "The Slim Shady LP" number 275 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time and 33 on its list of the "100 Best Albums of the '90s". In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked "The Slim Shady LP" as the 352nd Greatest Album of All-Time on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. NME ranked it number 248 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time. Blender ranked it number 49 in its list of The 100 Greatest American Albums of All-Time.

It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards. In 2015, it was ranked at number 76 by About.com in their list of "100 best hip-hop albums of all time". Christgau later named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.\n\nCommercial Performance\n\nIn the album's first week of release, "The Slim Shady LP" sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's "FanMail". The record remained on the Billboard 200 for 100 weeks. It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks. On April 5, 1999, "The Slim Shady LP" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. On November 15, 2000, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. "My Name Is", the album's lead single, peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the chart for ten weeks. The single additionally peaked at number 18 on the magazine's R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 29 on the Pop Songs chart, and 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. "Guilty Conscience" reached number 56 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while "Just Don't Give a Fuck" peaked at number 62 on the chart.\n\nBy November 2013, the album sold 5,437,000 copies in the United States. on the weekly Canadian Albums Chart and remained on the chart for twelve weeks. Additionally, the album was certified triple platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 units. The album was also certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Albums chart and remained on the chart for a total of 114 weeks. In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album had also peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions in the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively. It was certified gold in the Netherlands and platinum in New Zealand.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the success of "The Slim Shady LP", Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: "This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her. To promote "The Slim Shady LP", Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip-hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder." However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery." During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about "slapping a pregnant bitch" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of "The Slim Shady LP". The rapper defended himself by saying, "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be.\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" from "My Name Is". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a "lawsuit queen", and alleging that "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life." She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song "Brain Damage" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated "Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism." In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that "Guilty Conscience" contains an unauthorized sample of "Go Home Pigs" composed for the film "Getting Straight" by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album's liner notes state that the song contains an "interpolation" of "Go Home Pigs", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally.	f

He took a three-year hiatus even after fans were enjoying his 2010 record, Recovery. LP2 is a sequel to the album The Marshall Mather LP from 2000. It was the record that featured the classics like "Stan," "The Real Slim Shady," and many more. To celebrate its 10th birthday, Em decided to add an exclusive song and instrumentals of all the singles for the project.\n\nAccording to Southpawers, the additional track, "Don't Front" featuring Buckshot, was only available to those who ordered the Call of Duty: Ghosts and the album bundle. Eminem's ties to the video game come from the trailer for it, which included "Survival" as the theme song. Furthermore, the game also came out the same day MMLP2 dropped. On top of the song, Eminem also provided instrumental versions of the singles. Those being "Berserk," "Rap God," "Survival," "The Monster" with Rihanna, and "Headlights" with Nate Ruess.	f
88	4	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000-05-23	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/ede4eb76c5387e6a5b058283d3d77be5/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	The Marshall Mathers LP is the thrid studio album by American rapper  Eminem, released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and  Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including  Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip-hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing  Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised  Eminem's lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "I'm Back" and "Bitch Please II". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while "The Real Slim Shady" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album's sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann "Kim" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, "I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The "free" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to "map out" each song. He described himself as a "studio rat" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from "fucking around" in the studio; "Marshall Mathers" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while "Criminal" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. "Kill You" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n"Kim" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote "Kim" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. The song "Stan" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for "Stan" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard "Stan" and enjoyed it, and observed, "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote "The Way I Am" as his way of saying, "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs "liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the atmosphere of "Amityville". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem's major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics " the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to "dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, "Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Kill You"), the relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan", "I'm Back", and "Marshall Mathers"), his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"), his drug use ("Drug Ballad", "The Kids"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am", "Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes ("Criminal"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song "Criminal" features the line "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for "encourag violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. Eminem noted that he began using the word "faggot" more frequently when "people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse", but added, "I think it's hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, "Kill You", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper's first album, nightmares of "ladies' screams", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and "notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers'. The six-and-a-half minute long "Stan" samples Dido's "Thank You" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On "Who Knew", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem's response ranges oscillates from "smart-ass ('Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?') to smart ('Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?')."Who Knew" is followed by the "Steve Berman" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about "big-screen TVs, blunts, 40's, and bitches", while Eminem raps about "homosexuals and Vicodin", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n"The Way I Am" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being "pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. "The Real Slim Shady" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. "Remember Me?" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who "kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track". In the song, he states "I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image / So I promised the fuckin' critics / I wouldn't say 'fuckin' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)". Despite saying the word "fuck" one more time in "Remember Me", and three times at the beginning of "I'm Back", he does not say the word "fuckin" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song "Marshall Mathers".\n"I'm Back" features Eminem's observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he "became a commodity/'Cause I'm W-H-I-T-E". The next song, "Marshall Mathers", mocks the chorus of LFO's "Summer Girls", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. "Drug Ballad" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him "sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you". "Amityville" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. "Bitch Please II" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n"Kim", the prequel to "97 Bonnie and Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" "Kim" is followed by "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 "runs rampant" on the track. "Criminal" features production from F.B.T., which consists of "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...''. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that "half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP "resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like "ass", "bitch", "goddamn", and "shit" were uncensored. However, on the track "The Real Slim Shady", the words "bitch" and "shit" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs "Kill You", "Drug Ballad" and "Bitch Please II" are written as "**** You", "Ballad" and "***** Please II" on the back cover of the album. The song "Kim" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed "The Kids".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words "kids" and "Columbine" from the line, "I take seven  from , stand them all in line" from "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song "Rap God" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line "It doesn't matter  faggot" was also censored from "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album's first single, "The Real Slim Shady", became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. "The Way I Am", which was released as the album's second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. "Stan", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem's best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine's Touré applauded Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied lyrical style on what is a "car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem's startlingly intense vision of "rap's self-consciousness" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and "gruelling assault course of lyrical genius" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper's consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him "exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit", while declaring the album "a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is "indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was "mixed", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem's "verbal skills and transgressive humor" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, "docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem's "vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults" would "almost grow tedious if he weren't as inventive as he is tasteless." Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem's disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: "The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan's Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem's best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it "delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre." According to Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also "remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, "At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem's albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, "The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that "Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains "one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as "a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album's impact on white rappers, saying, "For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine's revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. Popdose listed The Marshall Mathers LP as the 10th best album of the decade. Spinner ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of "The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers". In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by About.com on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, The Marshall Mathers LP was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of Stacker, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for "promot violence of the most degrading kind against women", labeling him as "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape". She specifically cited lyrics from "Kill You", explaining, "He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has "long been a vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper "authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to "I'm Back" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, "Of course I'd heard of Elton John, but I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, "Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first" from "The Real Slim Shady", calling the rapper's claim "disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.\n\nIn 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song "Pulsion".	f
89	4	Music To Be Murdered By	2020-01-17	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/4d00a7848dc8af475973ff1761ad828d/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Music to Be Murdered By is the eleventh studio album by American rapper   Eminem. It was released on January 17, 2020, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. It was released with no prior announcement, in a similar fashion to his previous studio album Kamikaze (2018). The album was produced by  Eminem and Dr. Dre, amongst other producers. It features guest appearances from Skylar Grey, Young M.A, Royce da 5'9", White Gold, Ed Sheeran, the late Juice Wrld, Black Thought, Q-Tip, Denaun, Anderson .Paak, Don Toliver, Kxng Crooked, and Joell Ortiz.\n\nThe album's title, cover art, and concept are inspired by Alfred Hitchcock and Jeff Alexander's 1958 spoken word album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By. The album was supported by two singles: "Darkness" and "Godzilla". Alongside the album's surprise release,  Eminem also released the music video for "Darkness", which revolves around the 2017 Las Vegas shooting from the point of view of the perpetrator Stephen Paddock alternating with Eminem's own.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 279,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. Subsequently,  Eminem became the first artist to have ten consecutive number-one albums in the US and one of six artists to have released at least ten US number-one albums. Music critics praised Eminem's lyrical abilities and the improved production after Kamikaze, while criticism was directed towards the album's formulaic song structure, lack of innovation, and shock value.\n\nThe Mayor of Manchester, England, Andy Burnham, responded to  Eminem making light of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, saying, "This is unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful to the families and all those affected." The criticism of the album's subject matter led to  Eminem responding in an open letter, saying that Music to Be Murdered By is "not for the squeamish" and is "designed to shock the conscience.\n\nOn December 18, 2020,  Eminem released a deluxe version of the album, named Music to Be Murdered By: Side B, without any prior announcement. It includes the original album's 20 tracks along with 16 new ones. It includes a variety of features, with guest appearances from Skylar Grey, DJ Premier, Ty Dolla $ign, Dr. Dre, Sly Pyper, MAJ, and White Gold.\n\nIn 2019, A&R representative Mike "Heron" Herard of Shady Records pursued production contributions for a new album by  Eminem. This was a departure from his usual process at his company BeatleHustle, which manages sample composers who send their beats to high-profile producers. Eventually, a group of producers had been enlisted for the project, including Eminem's longtime creative partners Royce da 5'9" and Dr. Dre, as well as the latter's colleagues – Dawaun Parker, Lawrence Jr., Dem Jointz, and Erik Griggs – and young, burgeoning producers – D.A. Doman (producer of Tyga's "Taste") and Ricky Racks (producer of Future's "Crushed Up").\n\nAccording to a January 2020 Rolling Stone feature on the album's making, "Lawrence Jr. has been working sporadically with Dr. Dre since the rapper-producer left Death Row Records in the Nineties; starting in the summer, the drummer went into the studio with the rest of Dr. Dre's team to create a suite of tracks that ended up on the back half of Music to Be Murdered By." Lawrence Jr. told the magazine, "Dem Jointz is a producer, Eric Griggs plays keys, bass, and guitar, Dawaun Parker is a keyboard player and producer, myself, I'm a drummer. We know Dre’s instincts, and he’s the coach, the orchestrator.\n\nOther collaborators for the album included Black Thought, Q-Tip, Juice Wrld, Ed Sheeran, Young M.A, Skylar Grey, Don Toliver, Anderson .Paak, Kxng Crooked and Joell Ortiz. On the track "Godzilla", Eminem recorded a third verse that broke the record for the fastest verse on a charted track, rapping 10.65 syllables per second.  Eminem surpassed his own records held by his featured verse on Nicki Minaj's 2018 song "Majesty", where he rapped 10.3 syllables per second, and his 2013 single "Rap God", where he rapped 9.6 syllables per second.\n\nThe album's title and alternative cover art share the same concept as the 1958 album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By, which interspersed audio of the director Alfred Hitchcock's wry, dark humor into easy listening instrumentals arranged by Jeff Alexander. Eminem tweeted an image of the 1958 album cover featuring Hitchcock holding an axe and a gun to his head and stated that his album's alternative cover was "inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!". Audio of Hitchcock's voice from the 1958 album is sampled in the interludes "Alfred" and "Alfred (Outro)" and the beginning of the track "Little Engine". Both the 1958 and 2020 albums end with Hitchcock stating, "If you haven’t been murdered, I can only say better luck next time. If you have been, goodnight, wherever you are. Mark Beech of Forbes magazine connected the alternate cover to this album's concept of murder and violence.\n\nThe album has three covers; the standard cover features Eminem posing with a shovel, wearing a suit and a fedora. The album's alternate cover features Eminem pointing a gun and an axe to his head. The physical CD cover features Eminem, hatless, posing with his hands behind his back. In the packaging, Eminem dedicates the album to Juice Wrld, who died from an accidental drug overdose on December 8, 2019, and Eminem's former bodyguard CeeAaqil Allah Barnes who also died. Juice Wrld's feature on "Godzilla" marked his first posthumous release.\n\nThe album was released on January 17, 2020, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records and Shady Records. It was released as a surprise with no prior announcement, similarly to his previous and tenth studio album Kamikaze (2018). Alongside the album's release, Eminem also released a music video for "Darkness", directed by James Larese. The video, which revolves around the 2017 Las Vegas shooting from the point of view of the perpetrator Stephen Paddock alternating with Eminem's own, garnered appraisal but controversy too. On January 31, 2020, "Godzilla" was released as a single, with a music video directed by Cole Bennett later being released on March 6.\n\nMusic to Be Murdered By was met with mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 17 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". The aggregator AnyDecentMusic? has the critical consensus of the album at a 5.8 out of 10.\n\nReviewing for The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick said Music to Be Murdered By "offers over an hour of the world's greatest rapper blasting away on all cylinders", hailing it as "the first great album of 2020, so lethally brilliant  it should be a crime". Scott Glaysher of HipHopDX was also positive, and compared the album to Eminem's previous bodies of work, stating in his review that "Music To Be Murdered By is far from the star-studded, commercially sustainable album Recovery was, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. On this album, despite its handful of flaws, Em shows strong signs of adapting to the times through modern musical choices and smarter songwriting. Consequence of Sound's Dan Weiss was generally positive, and, about the album's themes, he said that "If he's figuring out from scratch how to be a compelling artist again, Eminem's improved the caliber of his beats and guests, taking stands against the right day-to-day injustices, toning down the tasteless (with the exception of the already-infamous Ariana line, of course), and rapping with the manic precision of someone who just snorted a whole sandcastle of cocaine and Vyvanse. If only a single minute of it was as hilarious or bracing as Chris D'Elia's impression of him. Similarly, Fred Thomas of AllMusic opined, "Music to Be Murdered By sees Eminem pulling himself out of Kamikaze's wreckage somewhat, though he still falls victim to moments of willful dumbness and a tedious self-obsession that's become par for the course. On the album's best tracks, there are still hints of the fire that made Eminem a rap legend.\n\nEntertainment Weekly's Christopher R. Weingarten was more critical, stating that, "As a whole, Music to Be Murdered By is as hit-and-miss as anything Eminem has released this side of the millennium. But remove the skits, the relationship songs, the family songs, the morose gun control song, and the quirky Ed Sheeran club goof and you still have 36 solid minutes of the daffy, one-of-a-kind rap genius that keeps captivating true-school heads and longtime fans. Or, if you'd like, keep it all and you still have the most solid work he's done in a few years.  NME's Jordan Basset was ambivalent towards the album's lyrical themes and stated, "He splits the difference on Music To Be Murdered By, indulging his immature ego (griping at bad reviews, stirring controversy for the sake of it) even as he offers salient social criticism and admits his missteps. He's ready to pass on hard-earned wisdom before running his mouth like he hasn't learned his own lessons. And he offers casual fans a hook or two before embarking on another lyrical work-out. Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork said that the album "is not, strictly speaking, a good record—Eminem hasn't made one of those in a decade—but his latest boasts enough technical command and generates just enough arresting ideas to hold your attention.\n\nThe song "Darkness", about the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and told from the point of view of the shooter Stephen Paddock alternating with Eminem's own, has garnered particular attention and critical acclaim.\n\nControversy\nThe lyrics of "Unaccommodating", in which Eminem referenced the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, drew significant criticism, with many critics finding the lyrics objectionable. The mayor of Manchester denounced the song's lyrics, describing them as "unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful." The lyrics also drew widespread criticism from victims' relatives and others involved in the attack.\n\nRoisin O'Connor of The Independent gave the album a negative review, and criticized the album by saying, "Eminem belittles the trauma of a then 26-year-old Ariana Grande for kicks on "Unaccommodating" by comparing himself to the Manchester Arena bomber. The sour taste of this track lingers well beyond the album's centerpiece, "Darkness", which is intended as a searing critique of America's toxic gun culture. Instead, his use of gunfire and explosion samples feels grossly exploitative.\n\nIn the United States, Music to Be Murdered By debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 279,000 album-equivalent units (including 117,000 copies as traditional album sales) in its first week. This became Eminem's tenth US number-one album and made him one of six artists to have released at least ten number-one albums. The album also accumulated a total of 217.6 million on-demand streams for the album’s tracks. As of December 2020, Music to Be Murdered By had sold over 1,053,000 equivalent units, including 249,000 in pure sales.\n\nEventually, Music to Be Murdered By was the 9th best-selling album (in pure sales) of 2020 in the United States, with 287,000 copies.\n\nThe album debuted at number-one in other countries. It became Eminem's 11th number-one album in Canada, while debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart with 33,000 album-equivalent units. The album remained at the top spot in Canada for four straight weeks, the longest for an Eminem album since Recovery. It also entered at number one on the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 36,000 album equivalent units, making Eminem the first artist to release 10 consecutive number one albums in the UK. He also achieved a chart double with Godzilla debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart.	f

The album was released on December 15, 2017, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. Production for the album took place from 2016 to 2017 at various recording studios. In addition to Eminem himself, music production was handled by various record producers, including Rick Rubin, Fredwreck, Skylar Grey, Alex da Kid, and executive producer Dr. Dre. Revival features guest appearances from artists Beyoncé, Phresher, Ed Sheeran, Alicia Keys, X Ambassadors, Skylar Grey, Kehlani, and Pink.\n\nEminem first revealed that he was working on an album following the release of "Campaign Speech" in October 2016. A year later, he performed a viral freestyle at the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards, criticizing President Donald Trump. The album has many lines critiquing Trump's presidential campaign and election.\n\nThe album's lead single, "Walk on Water" featuring Beyoncé, was released on November 10, 2017. "Untouchable" was released as a promotional single a week prior to the album's release. Revival was leaked online on December 13, 2017, two days before the album's release date. The album issued several more singles, including "River", featuring Ed Sheeran, "Nowhere Fast", featuring Kehlani, and "Remind Me". A music video for "Framed" was also released on April 3, 2018.\n\nRevival polarized critics, who were divided over its rock-influenced production on several songs and the heavy use of pop artists for guest appearances. The album debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Finland, the UK, and the US. In addition, it was the UK Christmas number one album of 2017 and has been certified platinum in the UK. It was followed by Kamikaze, Eminem's tenth studio album, which was considered to be a reaction to the criticism of Revival.\n\nEminem first revealed that he was working on an album when he announced the song "Campaign Speech" on his Twitter in October 2016, writing, "Don't worry I'm working on an album! Here's something meanwhile." Rumors about the release date started in late 2016, saying the album would be called Success and would be released sometime in January 2017. A fake tracklist also was leaked at the same time, with Adele, Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi, Vince Staples, The Weeknd and Mástein Bennett as featured artists. Rumors were sparked again in February and March 2017, when Eminem announced he was headlining three shows in Reading, Glasgow and Leeds. Various news articles said that because he was performing, he would have to release new material to perform, or at least preview, at the festivals.\n\nRevival has many lines critiquing Trump's presidential campaign and election, calling him a racist, a Nazi, and Adolf Hitler—among other incendiary insults and a fantasy in which the rapper is "framed" for murdering Ivanka Trump. He also raps his regret at having collaborated with Trump on a mock national convention in which Trump endorsed him. On "The Ringer" from his 2018 album Kamikaze, Eminem apologizes for alienating fans who supported Trump, and says that he was questioned by the U.S. Secret Service for his seemingly threatening lyrics.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, Paul Rosenberg posted a photo to Instagram of Yelawolf's Trial by Fire. In the background of the photo, there is a billboard ad promoting a drug called "Revival". Suspicion was aroused when fans noticed that the 'E' in "Revival" was reversed, similar to Eminem's previous logos. Visiting the website listed on the billboard ad revealed several clues. On the website, a promotional video about Revival makes references to Eminem's song "Lose Yourself". The website also references "Sing for the Moment", "Brain Damage", "Fack", "Role Model", and "Any Man". According to the website, Revival treats Atrox Rithimus, a nonexistent medical condition. One translation of Atrox Rithimus, from Latin, is 'terrible rhyme'. The website is also registered to one of Eminem's labels, Interscope Records. When the phone number for "Revival" is called, it plays the background music of Dr. Dre's "I Need a Doctor", which Eminem features on. These details led fans to believe Eminem's new album would be called Revival. This would follow suit with the names of two of his last three solo albums, Relapse and Recovery.\n\nThe lead single, "Walk on Water", was first performed by Eminem at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12 with co-producer and writer Skylar Grey on vocals. Both performed the song and a medley of "Stan" / "Love the Way You Lie" on Saturday Night Live on November 18. The album release date was teased multiple times. On November 28, 2017, the release date of the album was announced to be December 15 via both Dr. Dre's and Eminem's social media accounts, while also revealing the fake drug campaign of the record. On December 5, 2017, Eminem shared a complete list of all the tracks featuring on his album via his Instagram account. The list features a total of 19 tracks, including an interlude track to Revival, featuring artists such as Phresher, Ed Sheeran, Skylar Grey, Alicia Keys, X Ambassadors, Pink and Kehlani.\n\nOn December 7, 2017, the album cover was revealed and projected onto a Detroit building. That night, the song "Untouchable" was released and a pre-order was set up on iTunes.\n\nOn November 8, 2017, Eminem tweeted a picture of a doctor's prescription note with the words "Walk on Water" and "Take as needed" written on it. Additionally, the doctor's note was labeled with the logo for Revival. This caused speculation that the first single would be titled "Walk on Water". On November 9, Paul Rosenberg shared a video on Instagram linking the drug Revival with "Walk on Water" and confirming the song, which was subsequently released the next day. An audio video was uploaded to Eminem's YouTube channel. As of December 16, 2017, the video has nearly 50 million views and over 1.1 million likes. On December 23, 2017, the music video for the song was released exclusively on Apple Music and Eminem's official VEVO channel. "Walk on Water" debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 57th entry for both artists on the chart. "River" featuring Ed Sheeran was released as a second single of the album. The song was released to radio on January 5, 2018 and was released a single on February 7. An audio video was uploaded to Eminem's YouTube channel on December 14, 2017. As of January 15, 2018, the video has over 60 million views and 1 million likes. On February 14, 2018, the music video for the song was released on Eminem's official VEVO channel. Commercially, it has reached number one in the United Kingdom, Norway and Sweden as well as the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland, and the top 20 in Belgium and the United States.\n\nThe album's third single, "Nowhere Fast" featuring Kehlani, impacted US Contemporary hit radio on March 27, 2018. The two artists performed the song at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards. "Remind Me" was released to Italian radio as the fourth single from the album on July 6, 2018.\n\n"Framed", a horrorcore song, received a music video on April 3, 2018, inspired by 1980s horror films.\n\n"Untouchable" was released as a promotional single on December 8, 2017. The song features a sample from the song "Earache My Eye" by the comedy duo Cheech & Chong. A remix of "Chloraseptic" featuring 2 Chainz and Phresher was released as a promotional single on January 8, 2018.\n\nUpon release, Revival overall received polarized reviews from music critics as many were divided over its perceived lack of focus, lyrics, heavy sampling of rock music in the production, and the abundance of pop artists for guest appearances. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 50, based on 24 reviews, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.\n\nDon Needham of The Guardian criticized the album's production and focus, stating that "If Eminem thinks his verbal box of tricks can overcome the weakness of any backing track, his recent albums have demonstrated otherwise." In a positive review, Andy Gill of The Independent complimented the album's lyrical themes: "But ultimately, it's all about Eminem himself, and nowhere more dynamically than in the berserk self-assessment "Offended", where he asserts, amongst other things, that if the time he spent writing were taken into account, he'd be a minimum-wage slave – a faintly ludicrous claim, but immediately backed up by a bravura extended burst of rapid-rap babble that both explains and exemplifies his skills, and leaves one wondering not just how long it took to write, but how on earth he manages to pronounce such a polysyllabic torrent so perfectly." Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Revival "represents Eminem on top form, which is to say unstoppable, unbeatable yet often indefensible."\n\nThe Irish Times concluded that Revival is "mildly more admirable than previous outings but no more enjoyable. A chance to bust out of the slump has passed Eminem by. It just might never happen for him." In a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times remarked that while the album is "probably the best of his recent albums", he criticized Eminem's apparent lack of awareness to the evolution of hip hop's sound in general, arguing that he is too "beholden to his own aesthetic." In a negative review, Consequence of Sound gave the album an "F" rating, calling the album "ugly, arthritic, and pleasureless" and "a disaster".\n\nComparing Revival to Eminem's previous bodies of work, Matthew Ismael Ruiz of Pitchfork stated that "Musically, Revival is no different, chock full of piano ballads and pop-star features that echo the most cynically commercial corners of his catalog. The shock value comes not from the album's overwhelmingly bland hooks or cringe-worthy humor (of which there is plenty), but from the moments where his growth as a human is most apparent", concluding that "Revival is another late-career album that does little for his legacy." Writing for Vice, Robert Christgau found the album "much cleverer than lemmings claim, bluntly and intelligently political too, but so received in its cartoon misogyny and pop grandeur you know he felt irrelevance bearing down even before #MeToo killed this album on the vine". He singled out "Untouchable", "Chloraseptic", and "Like Home" as highlights.\n\nTrent Clark from HipHopDX said than "Eminem's dedication to wrecking mics like Robert Mueller can never be questioned but the production choices still remain an enigma. When he's not bathing in lamely visible rock samples like Joan Jett and the Blackhearts' "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" or The Cranberries' "Zombie" (on "Remind Me" or "In Your Head" respectively), he's mostly square pegging his intensified lyrics on mechanical slabs of assembly line pop hybrids." He singled out "Framed" and "Castle" as highlights: "it's largely the retreads of past glory where he hits his stride the hardest. On the hypnotically-produced "Framed," Marshall dons the hockey mask for old times sake and pulls up off homicidal fantasies that for better or worse, feature the album's most in-pocket rhyme moment. And when he plunges into his drug-altered psyche to speak on his greatest love — his daughter Haile Jade — the ever-reliable DJ Khalil steps up to the plate on "Castle" with a darkened soundbed of macabre guitars and deathly drum marches that feature the album's most vintage Eminem moment." Mitch Findlay from HotNewHipHop wrote a similar critics and said: "Revival is, by far, Eminem's most pop-friendly album to date. While previous albums merely flirted with the sound, Revival has bought a ring and proposed to it. Therefore, if you're somebody who finds no pleasure in the production of "pop-rap," you'll find no solace here." He singled out "Framed," "Castle" and "Arose" as highlights, calling the latter two are "among Revival's strongest tracks. Conceptually and lyrically, the closing pair find Eminem in excellent form, and longtime fans will no doubt cite these two as album highlights."\n\nAbout the album reaction, Eminem said: "I think there's things to be taken away from this album and the reaction to it. Were there too many songs? Were there too many features? There were certain songs like "Tragic Endings" and "Need Me" where I felt like lyrically they would give the listener a second to breathe. I spend a lot of time writing shit that I think nobody ever gets." Later he said: "When the Revival tracklist came down the pipe, it was like overwhelmingly, 'This shit is going to be trash.' Nobody really wanted to be wrong about it. I'm not saying everybody, but a lot of people had already formed their opinion." He also stated that he is proud of the album, saying: "I'm good with Revival. Fuck it. Because I couldn't have made this album without it."\n\nRevival is Eminem's eighth consecutive album to top the US Billboard 200, where it opened with 197,000 copies among 267,000 album-equivalent units. As a result, Eminem became the first musical act to have eight entries in a row debut at its summit. The next week, Revival was replaced at the top spot by Taylor Swift's reputation.\n\nRevival entered atop the UK Albums Chart with 132,000 album-equivalent units, becoming the year's second largest opening behind Ed Sheeran's ÷ and giving the rapper his eighth consecutive number-one album. As of October 2018, it sold 321,000 album-equivalent units in the UK.\n\nIt additionally arrived at number one in Australia, becoming his ninth entry to top the ARIA Albums Chart. The record then fell behind ÷ the following week.\n\nIn 2018, Revival was ranked as the 32nd most popular album of the year on the Billboard 200.	f
91	4	Encore	2006-07-13	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/5026c46b38ed035092df6cfc5a4a288f/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Encore is the fifth studio album by American rapper  Eminem. It was released on November 12, 2004, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. Its release date was originally set for November 17, 2004, but  Eminem moved the release date to five days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet. As reflected on the album cover— Eminem taking a bow—the album was widely considered to be  Eminem's final album of new material.\n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, most notably Eminem's opposition to then-President of the United States George W. Bush and a parody of Michael Jackson. The album features more comedic themes and lyrics than  Eminem's previous albums.\n\nCritical reception of Encore was less favorable than Eminem's previous albums, with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content, though "Mockingbird" and "Like Toy Soldiers" were particularly highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem's best songs. The album has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.\n\nEncore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson, who was upset about  Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". Retrospectively, the album is often considered to be one of  Eminem's worst albums alongside Revival (2017).\n\nContent\n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, including Eminem's relationship with his ex-wife, Kim, ("Puke", and "Love You More"), their daughter Hailie Jade Mathers ("Mockingbird"), his childhood ("Yellow Brick Road"), his relationships with his parents ("Evil Deeds"), and opposition to then-American President George W. Bush ("Mosh" and "We As Americans") "Just Lose It" is a parody of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean", as well as his Pepsi commercial accident in 1984. Similar to Eminem's previous album, The Eminem Show, Encore opens with a skit called "Curtains Up", indicative of the start of the show, and closes with "Curtains Down", indicative of the end.\n\nCensorship\n\nSimultaneously with the original, a censored version was released, from which most of the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the drug references had been edited out. "My 1st Single" has a bleep for the word "fuck" instead of a muted part on the hook: "This was supposed to be my first single, but I just fucked that off so... Fuck it let's all have fun let's mingle", the lines: "Smack a bitch and slap a ho" changed to "Grab a chick and Do-si-do". The second and third verses were edited with the words "Kim", "Pornos", "Fucking", and "Cum" on the second verse changed to the words; "Frickin", "Videos", "Cussing", and "Puff" (with an added explosion noise) respectively, and the third verse editing the word "Cock" with a chicken noise, and having "Dick" replaced with "Duck", along with the censored bleeps in replacement for the word "Fuck" as used on the hook. "Puke" has the word "Fucking" changed to "Fricking" throughout the song, "Shit" being replaced with "Shoot" near the end of the first verse, with the second verse being censored extensively with the line "You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die" changed to: "You're a freaking piece of poop, I hope you freaking die", and "I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut" changed to "I hate your freaking guts, you piece of poop". On "Just Lose It", the first verse censors "Molestation" with "Investigation". In "We as Americans" the words dead was back masked in both clean and explicit versions of the song, due to an investigation for the lyrics; "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president ". The word "ass" is left uncensored in "Yellow Brick Road", "One Shot 2 Shot", "Encore" and "We As Americans". However, it is censored out in "Ass Like That", "Mosh", "Spend Some Time", "My 1st Single", and "Just Lose It" (In this song's case, replaced with "Thing"), with the song "Rain Man", the word "ass" is used twice, but only censored once. The word "goddamn" was left uncensored in "Spend Some Time” while "Yellow Brick Road" leaves "goddamn" uncensored once. Other profanities on all other songs are blanked out; and the song "Ass Like That" is listed as "A** Like That". "Encore" has the shooting sequence at the end of the track removed on the censored album. "One Shot 2 Shot" has the violent content edited removing the intro and the word "shot" throughout the song. However, the original title remains written on the back cover.\n\nArtwork and packaging\n\nThe album featured two covers, the first cover features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a gun behind his back. The inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol in his mouth without the jacket of his shirt and tie. The CD itself shows a note written by Eminem saying "To my family & all my friends, thank you for everything, I will always love you. To my fans, I'm Sorry, Marshall" with a bullet underneath the note. The note is also seen in the album's booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everybody, which makes a reference to the ending of the album's title track. The second cover features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a blood splat on the top right. This cover is used for the Shady Collector's Edition.\n\nCritical reception\n\nEncore received generally positive reviews from critics, but received more of a negative response compared to his past 3 albums. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews. Josh Love from Stylus Magazine felt Eminem was "dying" with this album, whose concept was "end-to-end mea culpa", full of "clarifications, rectifications and excuses", revising the history of "a man who knows he doesn't have much time left". Scott Plangenhoef, writing for Pitchfork Media called Encore a "transitional record" and "the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games". BBC Music's Adam Webb believed it starts "fantastically" but ends "abominably", writing that it has too many "low points". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly said Eminem "sacrifices the rich, multi-textured productions" of his two previous albums for "thug-life monotony, cultural zingers for petty music-biz score-settling, and probing self-analysis for juvenile humor". He concluded his review by saying that Eminem has become "predictable" on Encore, something that he wasn't before.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine was more enthusiastic in his review for AllMusic, calling the music "spartan", built on "simple unadorned beats and keyboard loops", and the lyrics "plain-spoken and literal". Robert Christgau said Eminem still sounded "funny, catchy and clever, and irreverent past his allotted time", noting that even the bonus tracks "keep on pushing". In Rolling Stone, he wrote that Encore was not as "astonishing" as The Marshall Mathers LP, but praised Eminem for maturing his lyrical abilities while retaining his sense of humor. Steve Jones from USA Today also spoke positively about the album, calling Eminem's producing and lyrical skills as "top-flight" and noting that the record explores "the many sides of Marshall Mathers". The album earned Eminem Grammy Award nominations in three categories at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards: Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the song "Encore", and Best Rap Solo Performance for the song "Mockingbird".\n\nEncore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Michael Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service admitted it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States, George Bush, after the song "We as Americans", as an unreleased bootleg, circulated with the lyrics "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead." This line was eventually used as a sample in Immortal Technique's single "Bin Laden", which featured Mos Def and Chuck D. The incident was later referenced in the video for his song "Mosh" as one several news clips on a wall, along with other newspaper articles about other unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, with the word "dead" being reversed.\n\nAbout the album's reception, Eminem said: "I’m cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get Dre and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy. That’s how I ended up making songs like “Rain Man” and “Big Weenie.” They're pretty out there. If those other songs hadn't leaked, Encore would’ve been a different album." In the Kamikaze interview he did with Sway Calloway, although he stated that "Encore...  not what I would consider one of my better albums", in the same interview, he considered it better than its follow-up Relapse.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nEncore was pushed up to a mid week release to combat leaks. Regardless, it sold 711,000 copies with only 3 days of sales. The following week, the album's first with a full 7 days, it moved 871,000 copies, bringing the 10 day total to 1,582,000. It was certified quadruple-platinum that mid-December. Nine months after its release, worldwide sales of the album stood at 11 million copies. The album made digital history in becoming the first album to sell 10,000 digital copies in one week. As of November 2013, the album had sold 5,343,000 copies in the US.\n\nEncore sold 125,000 copies in two days in the United Kingdom, and was certified quadruple-platinum.	f
92	4	The Slim Shady LP	1999-01-01	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/83c5dc5ab4d1781ed3bb01c43956d71e/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rapper Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.\n\nFeaturing West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff," describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, "My Name Is", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nWhile The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album's success was vital in breaking the stereotype that "white people cannot rap", and has since been included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time. Spin later included it in their list of "The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014".\n\nBackground\n\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off." After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it." Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, "I don't give a fuck if you're purple. If you can kick it, I'm working with you." Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Slim Shady LP was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished "My Name Is" in an hour. Three other songs, including "Role Model", were also recorded that day.\n\n"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", which was formerly featured on the Slim Shady EP as "Just the Two of Us", was re-recorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." Eminem also said, "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." The song "Guilty Conscience" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre "fell out of his chair laughing" upon hearing the lyric.\n\n"Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in The Marshall Mathers LP 2. Another skit, "Bitch", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album. During the mixing process of The Slim Shady LP, at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, Devil Without a Cause; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem's song "My Fault", which appears on The Slim Shady LP; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song "Fuck Off" for Devil Without a Cause.\n\nProduction\nThe album's production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that "The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play." According to the staff at IGN, "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" is backed by the "lulling serenity of a super silky groove". "Cum on Everybody"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while "My Name Is", which is built around a sample from British musician Labi Siffre's "I Got The", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. "I'm Shady" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield's "Pusherman" in Ice-T's song "I'm Your Pusher", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use "Pusherman".\n\nEminem's vocal inflection on the album has been described as a "nasal whine"; Jon Pareles of The New York Times likened his "calmly sarcastic delivery" to "the early Beastie Boys turned cynical". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to "Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent". A skit entitled "Lounge" appears before "My Fault" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line "I never meant to give you mushrooms" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write "My Fault".\n\nLyrical themes\n\nMany of the songs from The Slim Shady LP are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, "I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word "nigga" on the album, noting, "It's not in my vocabulary." The Slim Shady LP begins with a "Public Service Announcement" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled "Paul" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to "tone down" his lyrics.\n\n"Guilty Conscience" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the "angel" and "devil" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in "Guilty Conscience", the outcome is unclear. On "My Fault", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an epilogue to the song "Kim", although "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that "There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words." On the song "Brain Damage", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school, particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully.\n\nAlthough many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks." Eminem was inspired to write "Rock Bottom" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished." "If I Had" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the "white trash" stereotype.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album was met with critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's "expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination", adding that "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music." David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's "unapologetic outrageousness" as a reaction to the "soul positivity" of conscious hip hop, noting that "The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch." Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" but lamented the "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem."\n\nMany reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, "Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that "the wife-killing jokes of "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is "sophomoric and uninspired" at times, Eminem's "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." Mike Rubin of Spin noted that "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are." Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1999, Robert Christgau called the record a "platinum-bound cause celebre" and, despite succumbing to "dull sensationalism" toward the end, Eminem shows "more comic genius than any pop musician since", possibly, Loudon Wainwright III."\n\nAccolades\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Eminem\nAt the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. Rolling Stone ranked The Slim Shady LP number 275 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and 33 on its list of the "100 Best Albums of the '90s". Blender ranked it number 49 in its list of The 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time.

It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards. In 2015, it was ranked at number 76 by About.com in their list of "100 best hip-hop albums of all time". Christgau later named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nIn the album's first week of release, The Slim Shady LP sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail. The record remained on the Billboard 200 for 100 weeks. It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks.

In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album had also peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions in the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively. It was certified gold in the Netherlands and platinum in New Zealand.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the success of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: "This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her. To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs.] He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder." However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery." During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about "slapping a pregnant bitch" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP. The rapper defended himself by saying, "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be.\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" from "My Name Is". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a "lawsuit queen", and alleging that "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life." She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song "Brain Damage" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated "Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism." In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that "Guilty Conscience" contains an unauthorized sample of "Go Home Pigs" composed for the film Getting Straight by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album's liner notes state that the song contains an "interpolation" of "Go Home Pigs", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally.	f

A double album, it is a successor of his previous greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, which was issued in 2005. The compilation covers the most recent years of Eminem's career, since his return to music from his hiatus, starting from the release of Relapse in 2009. The album also includes three new songs, "The King and I" featuring CeeLo Green (featured in the soundtrack of the film Elvis), "From the D 2 the LBC" featuring Snoop Dogg, and "Is This Love ('09)" featuring 50 Cent.\n\nBackground and promotion\nCurtain Call 2 was first hinted at by  Eminem in a tweet promoting the single "From the D 2 the LBC" on June 24, 2022, in which he included a hashtag with the album's name.  Eminem officially announced the album and its release date via social media on July 11.

Placed side by side, however, there's simply no comparison.\n\nCommercial performance\nThe album debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200, earning 43,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.

It was released on June 18, 2010, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It serves as the follow-up to Eminem's sixth studio album Relapse (2009). Originally planned to be released as Relapse 2, the album was renamed to Recovery when Eminem found the album to be musically different from its predecessor.\n\nProduction of the album took place during 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios and was handled by various record producers, including Alex da Kid, Just Blaze, Boi-1da, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter, and Dr. Dre. Eminem also collaborated with artists such as Pink, Lil Wayne, Slaughterhouse and Rihanna for the album. Recovery featured more introspective and emotional content than its predecessor and the theme of the album revolved around his positive changes, anxiety, and emotional drives.\n\nRecovery debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of 741,000 copies. It also reached number one in 16 other countries. It spawned four singles; "Not Afraid", "Love the Way You Lie", "No Love", and "Space Bound", with the former two both reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide and best-selling album in the US of 2010. The album received generally positive reviews by critics and was regarded as an improvement to Relapse. To promote it, Eminem performed the album's songs on televised shows, at award ceremonies, musical events and also headed The Recovery Tour.\n\nIn August 2011, Recovery was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2011 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year; the latter two were for "Love the Way You Lie". The album earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and Grammy Awards.\n\nBackground and production.\n\nDue to Eminem recording far more material than he could use for one album, he felt that he had to offer his fans more music. After staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem had in fact planned to put out two albums that year, following with Relapse 2 in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." Eminem also explained that the album was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill, which includes a bonus disc featuring seven new tracks, including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. During the recording process of the album, Eminem stated that "The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff to be heard". On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2", thus announcing that the album had been scrapped in favour of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result appeared to be more of an individual project that deserved its own name, other than a continuation of Relapse. Eminem said: "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title. The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nThe track 'Insult to Injury' would have been the leading track according to The Alchemist the producer of the track. 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' featuring D12 was a track that leaked that was recorded around early 2010 and style was more close to Recovery than Relapse. Cocaine featuring Jazmine Sullivan also leaked but it wasn't confirmand if it was for Relapse 2 or Recovery also recorded in 2010. 'Nut Up' was a leaked song from when Eminem was recording in Hawaii. 'Things Get Worse' was originally recorded in 2009 and was a solo track before Eminem and B.o.B collaborated for B.o.B's Greatest Hits album. On the track "Zeus" of Music To Be Murdered By, Eminem apologizes to Rihanna over a leaked version of 'Things Get Worse' in which he sided with Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault involving her in 2009. A song of unknown title featuring 50 Cent and two songs lead by Mr. Porter was also expected.\n\nAll the songs from Relapse: Refill were going to be part of Relapse 2. The songs "On Fire", "So Bad" and "Ridaz" from Recovery were recorded in the same sessions in Hawaii which lead to speculation that they could have been intended for Relapse 2. Although after the release of Relapse: Refill it is possible that Eminem had already moved on to Recovery.\n\nThemes and composition\n\nThe album was dedicated "To anyone who's in a dark place tryin' to get out. Keep your head up… It does get better! Eminem told Billboard that he was in "full-blown addiction" while recording Encore. He felt happier and "first got sober" during the recording of Relapse, having overcome his addiction. While recording Relapse, he admitted that he had not been "paying attention to what the average listener might like or not like." Just Blaze, the first producer of the album said, " already knew what sort of mistakes he has made with the previous album and where he wanted to go from there." Thus, Recovery was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records. In contrast to Eminem's previous work, the album features no skits, and downplays his Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nThe album's artwork featured two covers: One with Eminem walking down a country road and another with him sitting in a transparent living room in the middle of Detroit with the Renaissance Center in the background. The album's liner featured pictures of Eminem such as a picture of him praying and him posing without a shirt on.\n\nThe record opens with "Cold Wind Blows" in which Eminem discusses his "doomed love for his ex-wife" and about "settling scores with rival celebs. In "Talkin' 2 Myself", he states the harm caused to his image with lyrics such as: "Encore' I was on drugs, 'Relapse' I was flushing them out. "On Fire" is about "a murder-and-dismemberment fantasy" and "Won't Back Down", which featured Pink, was a rap rock song. The singing to "W.T.P." ("White-Trash Party") is considered similar to his early records with lighter and simple rhythmic frame. "Going Through Changes", which samples Black Sabbath's "Changes", depicts Eminem's sorrow and shows himself trapped within fame. "Not Afraid", a mid-tempo song, focuses on personal changes in Eminem, including an end to drug abuse, feuds and violence.\n\nIdolator commented that the song was based on the "dark days Eminem has lived through," and "he seems to be at peace with himself now. A writer for MuchMusic website noted that Eminem chose to use his Marshall Mathers ego for the song, rather than Slim Shady.\n\n"No Love" features Lil Wayne as a hype man. Eminem's verses follow Lil Wayne, and according to Sam Wolfson of NME were "the best verses of his career. The meaning of "Space Bound" is deemed ambiguous and according to Sasha Grey who is featured in its video, the meaning can be interpreted "in many ways. Jim Jonsin of MTV spoke about Eminem's two egos seen in the video and compared it to Alanis Morissette's "Ironic" video while Grey believed that the alternate Eminem who appears in the car is his subconscious.\n\n"Cinderella Man" has a "festive beat" and "the template of every album since Encore (2004)," with many minor keys and traces of post-grunge rock. "25 to Life" shows his discomfiture and depicts that the "selfish bitch" pulling him back "these days is rap itself. Despite the lyrics being tighter throughout the album, "So Bad" and "Almost Famous" view the other side of Slim Shady; his alter ego. The hip-hop ballad "Love The Way You Lie", which features Rihanna, describes a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. Rihanna sings the chorus, backed by an electric guitar and a piano, while acoustic guitar, violin and drums accompany Eminem's verses. Rihanna's singing expresses "grief and regret" throughout the song.\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nTo promote the album Eminem released a freestyle titled "Despicable" about "Over" by Drake and "Beamer, Benz, or Bentley" by Lloyd Banks featuring Juelz Santana to promote the first single, "Not Afraid", which debuted on Shade 45 on April 29.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on 28 reviews. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised Eminem's performance as potent and energetic, and said that the album "may be flawed … but he hasn't sounded this unfiltered and proud since The Marshall Mathers LP". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph commended him for addressing more mature, introspective subject matter and successfully "framing his misogyny, homophobia and all-round bigotry with an undeniable sense of empathy and humanity. Jody Rosen, writing in Rolling Stone, called it Eminem's "most casual-sounding album in years" and said that he "sounds content to be rap's wittiest head case.\n\nSam Wolfson of NME called him "self aware, technically advanced, intelligent, able to go at speeds other than full throttle. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club stated that his lively raps make up for the "endless atonement metaphors" that occasionally weigh down the album. Kitty Empire, writing in The Observer, said that it is "better than average" as a "latterday Eminem album" that shows, "in bursts, Eminem's health is very nearly rude." MSN Music's Robert Christgau said that, although the cleverness "varies" and the themes are "rarely" upheld by his "long-recessive sense of play", the album is a comeback "for Eminem, not Slim Shady—and for Marshall at his most martial. His most confessional as well.\n\nIn a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times regarded Eminem as "frustratingly limited in his topical range" and called Recovery "the most insular of all his releases. Andy Gill of The Independent commented that "there's nothing here quite as witty or engaging as" on his previous work. In a largely negative review, Pitchfork's Jayson Greene perceived a lack of lyrical depth and wrote "for the first time in his career, he actually sounds clumsy. Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot criticized the writing, and said that it lacks hooks and fun: "The subversive humor is long gone, and his cultural references … remain dated. Slant Magazine's M. T. Richards also found Eminem's pop culture references "inane" and called the album's material "unsurprisingly hollow" with punchlines that "rarely resonate. Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss found his rhyme schemes "dazzling" and wordplay "clever", but panned its production as "monochromatic and monotonous. The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said that the music lacks consistency because of a "piecemeal approach to production" and "fashionable soft-rock samples.\n\nRecovery was ranked 93rd on the Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time.\n\nAccolades\n\nIn 2010, Eminem was nominated for two American Music Awards Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album which he Won it and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. In 2011, He also was nominated for two Billboard Music Awards: "Top Billboard 200 Album" and "Top Rap Album" he Won both. he also nominated for Brit Awards: "Best International Album".

96	4	Encore (Deluxe Version)	2004-11-12	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/c70c68f2f8aa376093774b931e04d018/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Encore is the fifth studio album by American rapper  Eminem. It was released on November 12, 2004, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. Its release date was originally set for November 17, 2004, but  Eminem moved the release date to five days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet. As reflected on the album cover— Eminem taking a bow—the album was widely considered to be  Eminem's final album of new material.\n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, most notably Eminem's opposition to then-President of the United States George W. Bush and a parody of Michael Jackson. The album features more comedic themes and lyrics than  Eminem's previous albums.\n\nCritical reception of Encore was less favorable than Eminem's previous albums, with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content, though "Mockingbird" and "Like Toy Soldiers" were particularly highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem's best songs. The album has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.\n\nEncore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". \n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, including Eminem's relationship with his ex-wife, Kim, ("Puke", and "Love You More"), their daughter Hailie Jade Mathers ("Mockingbird"), his childhood ("Yellow Brick Road"), his relationships with his parents ("Evil Deeds"), and opposition to then-American President George W. Bush ("Mosh" and "We As Americans") "Just Lose It" is a parody of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean", as well as his Pepsi commercial accident in 1984. Similar to Eminem's previous album, The Eminem Show, Encore opens with a skit called "Curtains Up", indicative of the start of the show, and closes with "Curtains Down", indicative of the end.\n\nSimultaneously with the original, a censored version was released, from which most of the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the drug references had been edited out. "My 1st Single" has a bleep for the word "fuck" instead of a muted part on the hook: "This was supposed to be my first single, but I just fucked that off so... Fuck it let's all have fun let's mingle", the lines: "Smack a bitch and slap a ho" changed to "Grab a chick and Do-si-do". The second and third verses were edited with the words "Kim", "Pornos", "Fucking", and "Cum" on the second verse changed to the words; "Frickin", "Videos", "Cussing", and "Puff" (with an added explosion noise) respectively, and the third verse editing the word "Cock" with a chicken noise, and having "Dick" replaced with "Duck", along with the censored bleeps in replacement for the word "Fuck" as used on the hook. "Puke" has the word "Fucking" changed to "Fricking" throughout the song, "Shit" being replaced with "Shoot" near the end of the first verse, with the second verse being censored extensively with the line "You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die" changed to: "You're a freaking piece of poop, I hope you freaking die", and "I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut" changed to "I hate your freaking guts, you piece of poop". On "Just Lose It", the first verse censors "Molestation" with "Investigation". In "We as Americans" the words dead was back masked in both clean and explicit versions of the song, due to an investigation for the lyrics; "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president ". The word "ass" is left uncensored in "Yellow Brick Road", "One Shot 2 Shot", "Encore" and "We As Americans". However, it is censored out in "Ass Like That", "Mosh", "Spend Some Time", "My 1st Single", and "Just Lose It" (In this song's case, replaced with "Thing"), with the song "Rain Man", the word "ass" is used twice, but only censored once. The word "goddamn" was left uncensored in "Spend Some Time” while "Yellow Brick Road" leaves "goddamn" uncensored once. Other profanities on all other songs are blanked out; and the song "Ass Like That" is listed as "A** Like That". "Encore" has the shooting sequence at the end of the track removed on the censored album. "One Shot 2 Shot" has the violent content edited removing the intro and the word "shot" throughout the song. However, the original title remains written on the back cover.\n\nThe album featured two covers, the first cover features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a gun behind his back. The inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol in his mouth without the jacket of his shirt and tie. The CD itself shows a note written by Eminem saying "To my family & all my friends, thank you for everything, I will always love you. To my fans, I'm Sorry, Marshall" with a bullet underneath the note. The note is also seen in the album's booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everybody, which makes a reference to the ending of the album's title track. The second cover features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a blood splat on the top right. This cover is used for the Shady Collector's Edition.\n\nEncore received generally positive reviews from critics, but received more of a negative response compared to his past 3 albums. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews. Josh Love from Stylus Magazine felt Eminem was "dying" with this album, whose concept was "end-to-end mea culpa", full of "clarifications, rectifications and excuses", revising the history of "a man who knows he doesn't have much time left". Scott Plangenhoef, writing for Pitchfork Media called Encore a "transitional record" and "the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games". BBC Music's Adam Webb believed it starts "fantastically" but ends "abominably", writing that it has too many "low points". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly said Eminem "sacrifices the rich, multi-textured productions" of his two previous albums for "thug-life monotony, cultural zingers for petty music-biz score-settling, and probing self-analysis for juvenile humor". He concluded his review by saying that Eminem has become "predictable" on Encore, something that he wasn't before.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine was more enthusiastic in his review for AllMusic, calling the music "spartan", built on "simple unadorned beats and keyboard loops", and the lyrics "plain-spoken and literal". Robert Christgau said Eminem still sounded "funny, catchy and clever, and irreverent past his allotted time", noting that even the bonus tracks "keep on pushing". In Rolling Stone, he wrote that Encore was not as "astonishing" as The Marshall Mathers LP, but praised Eminem for maturing his lyrical abilities while retaining his sense of humor. Steve Jones from USA Today also spoke positively about the album, calling Eminem's producing and lyrical skills as "top-flight" and noting that the record explores "the many sides of Marshall Mathers". The album earned Eminem Grammy Award nominations in three categories at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards: Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the song "Encore", and Best Rap Solo Performance for the song "Mockingbird".\n\nEncore provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Michael Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service admitted it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States, George Bush, after the song "We as Americans", as an unreleased bootleg, circulated with the lyrics "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead." This line was eventually used as a sample in Immortal Technique's single "Bin Laden", which featured Mos Def and Chuck D. The incident was later referenced in the video for his song "Mosh" as one several news clips on a wall, along with other newspaper articles about other unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, with the word "dead" being reversed.\n\nAbout the album's reception, Eminem said: "I’m cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get Dre and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy. That’s how I ended up making songs like “Rain Man” and “Big Weenie.” They're pretty out there. If those other songs hadn't leaked, Encore would’ve been a different album." In the Kamikaze interview he did with Sway Calloway, although he stated that "Encore...  not what I would consider one of my better albums", in the same interview, he considered it better than its follow-up Relapse.	f
97	4	Music To Be Murdered By - Side B (Deluxe Edition)	2020-12-18	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/55d424a53904d145b17869ba133843d7/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Music To Be Murdered By - Side B (Deluxe Edition) was released on December 18, 2020 as a deluxe edition of Eminem's tenth studio album of the same name. Similar to Eminem's previous two albums, it was released without any prior announcement. It contains a bonus disc with sixteen new tracks, with guest appearances by Skylar Grey, DJ Premier, Ty Dolla $ign, Dr. Dre, Sly Pyper, MAJ, and White Gold. A music video accompanied the album's release for "Gnat", directed by Cole Bennett. The music video for "Higher" premiered on January 23, 2021. Lyric videos for "Tone Deaf" and "Alfred's Theme" were also released. In May 2021, a remix of "Killer", featuring Jack Harlow and Cordae, was released.\n\nThe week the deluxe edition was released, the album saw a 1,125% boost in sale units from the previous week, moving 94,000 units. This brought the album back up to the 3rd spot on the Billboard 200 album chart in its 48th week, a 196-spot jump from the week previous, breaking a 50-year-old Billboard 200 record previously held by Bob Dylan with "Self Portrait" which made a 193 spot jump.\n\n"Side B" was met with generally positive reviews. Robert Christgau appraised the release as "more proof that Eminem loves rhyme as compulsively as MF DOOM himself", adding that, "If he’s not as playful or surreal about it as DOOM, he sure does enunciate better, with a timbral dexterity never quashed by the rock-inflected production style that Dr. Dre laid on him decades ago and oversees here." While highlighting lyrics from "Alfred's Theme", "Tone Deaf", "Black Magic", and "These Demons" on "Side B", he also observed "more braggadocio and less delight in these words for their own sake than in the Side A's".	f

It was released on May 19, 2009, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It was his first album of original material since Encore (2004), following a four-year hiatus from recording due to his writer's block and an addiction to prescription sleeping medication. Recording sessions for the album took place from 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios, and Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, and  Eminem handled production.\n\nRelapse is a concept album that revolves around horror, drug rehabilitation, and relapse. A return to his Slim Shady alter ego,  Eminem stated that the album's theme was more reminiscent of The Slim Shady LP (1999) and The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months to the production of the album. Working with Dr. Dre allowed  Eminem to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged his rhythm to experiment with different flows. During the recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet.\n\nOne of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 608,000 copies in its first week. It also reached number one in twelve other countries. It produced four singles: "Crack a Bottle", "We Made You", "3 a.m.", and "Beautiful", as well as the promotional single: "Old Time's Sake". "Crack a Bottle", featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Relapse was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nCritically, the album received mixed reviews. Reviewers generally praised its production but were divided in their responses towards the writing and overuse of accents throughout the album. Nonetheless, it won Eminem the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while "Crack a Bottle" won Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The album later found a strong cult following among  Eminem's fans and critics, establishing Relapse as a cult classic.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter releasing Encore in 2004, Eminem planned to take some time off from recording his own music to become a hip-hop producer for other rap acts, especially for the artists signed on his own label Shady Records. However, Eminem entered his hiatus after canceling the European leg of the Anger Management Tour in the summer of 2005 because of exhaustion and an addiction to prescription sleeping drugs. In the following year, the rapper's remarriage to his former wife Kimberly Scott lasted only eleven weeks before a second divorce, while his best friend and fellow rapper Proof was later shot and killed during an altercation outside a Detroit nightclub. Devastated, Eminem relapsed into prescription drug abuse and became increasingly reclusive. In a June 2009 interview for XXL, Eminem elaborated on the impact of Proof's death on him, stating:\n\n"Everyone felt  loss, from his kids, to his wife, to everyone. But, for some reason, in hindsight, the way I felt was almost like it happened to just me... Maybe at the time I was a little bit selfish with it. I think it kind of hit me so hard. It just blindsided me. I just went into such a dark place that, with everything, the drugs, my thoughts, everything. And the more drugs I consumed, and it was all depressants I was taking, the more depressed I became, the more self-loathing I became..."\n\nSpeculation on an upcoming album by Eminem was reported since mid–2007 from announcements made by artists 50 Cent and Stat Quo, former members of Shady Records. Also, rapper Bizarre – a member of the hip-hop group D12 – stated that the release of the group's third studio album was on hold because Interscope Records wanted to release Eminem's album first. By the end of the year, additional musicians associated with Shady Records – including The Alchemist, Bishop Lamont, Cashis, and Obie Trice – had confirmed on different occasions that the rapper was effectively working on a new album. On September 12, 2007, during a call at the radio station WQHT Hot 97, Eminem stated that he was in limbo and was not sure whether he would release any new material in the near future. He then elaborated that at that point he was constantly working in the recording studio and had come to terms with his personal issues. However, in December 2007, he was hospitalized because of an overdose of methadone. In early 2008, he began a 12-step program to recover from his addiction; in a later interview, he said that he got sober on April 20, 2008. He has stayed sober since then.\n\nRecording\n\n Eminem continued recording throughout 2005 and released most of this work on his Shady Records compilation album  Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. He also recorded the track "Beautiful" in late 2007, which would later become the fifth and final single on Relapse, and also one of the only songs on the entire album which Eminem recorded when he wasn't sober.  Eminem began the major recording stages of Relapse in mid-2008, after completing a 12-step program to control his drug addiction. Record producer and long-time Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers worked with Eminem on 25 tracks, two years after the rapper had received treatment for his sleeping pill addiction in 2005. Depressed by Proof's death, Eminem fell into a period of "writer's block", where he felt everything he wrote was not worth recording. To compensate for this, Bass chose to follow a production style that would allow the artist to rap "off the top of his head, as opposed to writing a story". Eminem would then freestyle or record vocals one line at a time before interrupting and then recording another line. At the same time, according to Eminem's song rights supervisor Joel Martin, the rapper began to collect additional songs without noticing it. He would often record or produce material initially intended for the musical projects of other artists, but end up with tracks he really liked.\n\nEminem purchased the Effigy Studio in Ferndale, Michigan, in 2007, and ended his working relationship with much of his former production team of the 54 Sound recording studio, including the Bass Brothers. In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months to the production of Relapse. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to concentrate on the processes of songwriting rather than the production, which was largely taken care of by Dre. The rapper justified his choice of using Dr. Dre for the vast majority of the production due to their long collaborative history and a musical "chemistry" only he and Dr. Dre shared. This allowed the rapper to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged him rhythm-wise to experiment with different flows. The making of the album progressed at the Effigy Studio up to a year after, as recording sessions were then moved to Orlando, Florida in September 2008. By then, Eminem had begun to start writing verses again at such a pace that he often took more time to record the lyrics than write them. He credited sobriety for his new creative run, acknowledging that his mind was free of the clutter that "blocked" him during his drug abuse in the last years. Dr. Dre would start the song-writing process by giving a number of his beats on a CD to Eminem, who in a separate room in the studio would listen and select the ones he preferred and inspired him the most. Eminem would then write lyrics to the instrumentals, while Dr. Dre and his production staff continued to create new music. Once he felt he had written lyrics for enough songs, Eminem would dedicate an entire day to record his songs to the point that he would lose his voice for the following days. At that point, the rapper would then begin to write lyrics for new songs. The process continued for the next six months and allowed Eminem to have enough material for a second album, initially called Relapse 2, which became Recovery.\n\nDuring this recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet, including an incomplete version of "Crack a Bottle". The song was finished in January 2009 and featured vocals from Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Despite the leak, the album was being completed in a state of near-total secrecy, according to the British newspaper The Independent. Even Polydor Records, the multinational owner of Interscope, had no information on the album at the time. On April 23, Eminem suggested he and possibly Dr. Dre were the only ones in possession of the final copy of Relapse; his manager Paul Rosenberg added that even Eminem's record labels were not in possession of the music less than a month before its release to prevent possible bootlegging.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nIn an interview for XXL, Eminem described the concept behind Relapse to be the ending of his drug rehabilitation and thus rap as if he was on drugs again, as well as the return of his fictional alter-ego Slim Shady. According to the interviewer Datwon Thomas, Eminem's influences for the album came from his own past drug issues and from television shows and documentaries involving crime and serial killers, as the rapper was fascinated by "serial killers and their psyche and their mind states". In a May 2009 interview for The New York Times, Eminem discussed his view of serial killers, stating:\n\n"You listen to these people talk, or you see them, they look so regular. What does a serial killer look like? He don’t look like anything. He looks like you. You could be living next door to one. If I lived next door to you, you could be."\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau interpreted the opening line to the album featuring the phrase "horror corridor" as Eminem telling listeners that it is a horrorcore album. Ben Kaplan of the Vancouver Courier also categorized it as a horrorcore album. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times said that the album's "horrorcore scenes" show Eminem as "a madman created by the hypocrisy of therapy." Music journalist Rob Sheffield remarked on its sensationalist drug references and said that Relapse is "a hip-hop version" of comedian Richard Pryor's Live on the Sunset Strip (1982).\n\nSongs\nRelapse opens with the skit "Dr. West", where actor Dominic West voices a drug counselor whose untrustworthiness causes Eminem to fall back to drugs and the return to his Slim Shady character. The skit leads to "3 A.M.", where Eminem depicts himself as a serial killer during a murder spree. When "3 A.M." was released as a single prior to the album's own release, Eminem noted that the song closely mirrored what he believed was the overall dark tone of the album. On "My Mom", the rapper traces his addictive tendencies to his mother and shows how he became a drug addict just like her. Eminem continues his family tales on "Insane", where he imagines himself as a victim of child sexual abuse. For Eminem, the goal of "Insane" was to make song that would disgust the listeners and "make them puke", adding that he came up with this idea after thinking of the song's first line ("I was born with a dick in my brain/Yeah, fucked in the head"). Mariah Carey and her then current husband Nick Cannon are targeted in "Bagpipes from Baghdad", where Eminem raps over a pungi loop.\n\nAfter "Hello", where Eminem re-introduces himself after years of being absent "mentally", he continues his violent fantasies on "Same Song & Dance", where he abducts and murders Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. The upbeat rhythm of "Same Song & Dance" reminded Eminem of a dance track, which inspired him to write something in order to "get women to dance to it and not really know what the fuck they're dancing to" without listening to the lyrics. On the ninth track of the album, "We Made You", Eminem mocks several celebrities and plays the role of a "pop star serial killer". Eminem noted that his various "celebrity bashings" were not meant to be seen as personal attacks, but it was rather "picking names out of a hat" that rhymed with the words he wanted to use during the writing process. On "Medicine Ball" Eminem mocks and impersonates deceased actor Christopher Reeve in order to get his audience to "laugh at it, and then almost feel bad for laughing". The next track is "Stay Wide Awake", which Eminem raps about assaulting and raping women. Dr. Dre also has a guest appearance on "Old Time's Sake", a duet Eminem described as a "fun, yet reminiscent record old times" in which he and Dre rap back and forth between each other, advocating the use of marijuana for creative and financial benefits. Song "Must Be the Ganja" follows, where Eminem raps that working in the recording studio is like a drug and an addiction for him.\n\nAfter the skit "Mr. Mathers", where Eminem is found unconscious in bathroom by paramedics due to a drug overdose and taken to a hospital, "Déjà Vu" addresses his overdose in 2007 and drug dependency during his hiatus from music. On the song, Eminem also explains how this has affected him in the last five years, to the point where his daughter has become scared of her father's behavior. "Beautiful", a ballad which samples "Reaching Out" by Queen + Paul Rodgers, also deals with the same time period where Eminem believed he had "reached rock bottom" and lost hope for his future. Eminem felt it was important to include "Beautiful" on the album as a reminder to himself as well as "anybody who is in a dark place  that you can get out of it". After "Crack a Bottle", a collaboration with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, Relapse ends with "Underground". On this final track, Eminem sought to bring back to his music and lyrics the subject matter and punchlines reminiscent of "The Hiphop Shop times" (The Hiphop Shop was a clothing store in Detroit where local rappers, including Eminem, would compete in freestyle battles), before he had become famous and thus did not have worry about the explicit content of his lyrics.\n\nRelapse: Refill, Relapse 2 and Recovery\n\nBecause Eminem recorded far more material than he could use for one album and felt that he had to offer his fans more music after staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem in fact had planned to put out two albums the same year, following with Relapse 2, in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." Eminem also explained the album was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, " rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill, which includes a bonus disc featuring seven new tracks, including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year."\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2", thus announcing that the album has been scrapped in favor of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result did not seem to him as continuation of Relapse but more of an individual project that deserved its own name. Eminem said: "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nRelease and promotion\n\nIn 2007, Shady Records rapper Cashis discussed the album, referring to it by the title King Mathers and adding that it would be released later that year. However, Eminem's publicist Dennis Dennehy would later deny this and stated that "there  no album scheduled for a 2007 release" and that, as of August 2007, there was no confirmed title. No other official statement was made for over a year. It was not until September 15, 2008, at an event held by Shade 45 to celebrate the publication of Eminem's autobiography The Way I Am, the rapper confirmed his plans to release a studio album by the title of Relapse. During the party, he also previewed to the audience a song called "I'm Having a Relapse".\n\nIn regards to the album's release date, Rolling Stone wrote in its October 2008 issue that Virgin Megastores had planned to distribute Relapse on November 27, 2008 in the United States. On October 27, a spokesperson for Interscope explained that there was no official date at the time, and that any release dates that had been posted on any website were unfounded. In a phone conversation during the finale of Total Request Live on November 16, 2008, Eminem asserted that Relapse would be released during the first quarter of 2009, precisely during either of the first two months of the year, explaining that he was in the process of selecting the songs for the album.\n\nDespite the leak two months before, "Crack a Bottle" was eventually released for legal paid digital download as well as a promotional single on February 2, 2009, and also reached the number one position on the US Billboard Hot 100; according to Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg, a music video for the song had been produced and directed by Syndrome and was released in several parts of the world from May to early June. At the time of the release, various contradicting reports disputed whether the song would be included on Relapse, but a press release from head label Universal Music Group confirmed the single's inclusion on the album. In similar press statements after March 5, Universal made public the regional release dates for Relapse: as early as May 15, 2009, in Italy and the Netherlands; most other European countries and Brazil on May 18; and the following day in the United States and Australia. Additionally, the record label also announced a second album by Eminem, then called Relapse 2 but later titled Recovery, which was to be released by the end of the year, but expected in June 2010. Eminem explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, by releasing two albums, would allow listeners to have access to all of his music.\n\nAfter the release of "Crack a Bottle", the music video of the single "We Made You" was aired on April 7, and became available for purchase a week later on April 13. The video was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered simultaneously on several MTV channels as well as MTV's website. On April 28, the third overall single for the album, "3 a.m.", was released again for paid music download. A music video for "3 a.m." was directed by Syndrome and filmed in Detroit. It premiered on May 2 on Cinemax, several days after a trailer for the video was posted online. Two more singles were distributed prior to the album's release, as "Old Time's Sake" and "Beautiful" went on sale on the iTunes Store on May 5 and 12 respectively. "My Darling" and "Careful What You Wish For" were made available upon purchase of the Premium version of the album. The track "Insane" peaked at position 85 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on the album's release via iTunes.\n\nOn April 4, 2009, CBS featured Eminem during the network's coverage of the 2009 NCAA Final Four in a segment where he recited the spoken word "Love Letter to Detroit". Later on the same day, the rapper inducted the hip hop group Run-D.M.C. to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Adam Graham of The Detroit News described this as "all part of the calculated promotional push" for Relapse. The rapper performed live at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards on May 31, while he appeared on the covers of hip hop magazines Vibe and XXL in their respective issues in June 2009; the latter was created by a deal struck with Eminem and Marvel Comics, where the rapper would pose as Marvel's main vigilante The Punisher. Marvel created an issue of the comic co-starring Eminem. An iPhone game to accompany the album was released on May 19, 2009.\n\nWhile on the Never Say Never tour, fellow group members Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" stopped by KISS 100FM for a live interview and spoke on Relapse. Royce stated that the album will be a game changer and jokingly said he might have to push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't sure if they would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year".\n\nArtwork\nThe album cover for Relapse was first published through Eminem's Twitter account on April 21, 2009. It illustrates a head shot of the rapper composed by a mosaic of thousands of pills. A sticker on the cover resembles a prescription drug label, on which the patient is Eminem and the prescribing doctor is Dr. Dre. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described the cover as a reference to the rapper's struggle and addiction to prescription drugs, adding that it follows Eminem's habit of displaying personal issues in his art. The album booklet and back cover follow a pill prescription design. On the backside of the booklet is a dedication to Proof, where Eminem explains that he's sober and that he tried to write a song for him, but that he didn't find one of them good enough therefore he dedicates the whole album to him. The CD itself is meant to represent the lid on a bottle of prescription pills, grey with the big red inscription "Push Down & Turn". The cover for Relapse: Refill is the same, with the background color changed from black to white. The prescription drug label is scratched out and the writing "Refill" is posed next to it.\n\nCritical reception\n\nRelapse received a mostly mixed reception from music critics upon release. It holds an aggregate score of 59, based on 27 reviews, at Metacritic. Despite calling it an "impressively focused and clever work", Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers felt the music was "not transcendent" and commented that "Eminem could have pulled his music into a new category. What he presents is still powerful, but narrowly cast". Andy Gill of The Independent found the album to be "drably repetitive, while its dated tone is emphasised by the return of Dr Dre as producer." NME's Louis Pattison found Eminem's wordplay "wicked in the depths of its depravity", but felt that "the overriding feel is of an album just too jaded, too joyless to truly count as a return to form". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson viewed that "the further Relapse strays from narrative veracity, the more one suspects his fanbase feels he's tapping into his bottomless well for horror-show grandstanding." The Times called Relapse "an album that sits square between what Eminem is theoretically still capable of and what we feared he has become." Nathan Rabin, writing in The A.V. Club, panned it as "facile pre-adolescent shock mixed with gory, corpse-strewn, Fangoria-damaged horrorcore." MSN Music's Robert Christgau called it a "dud" and accused Eminem of sensationalism: "this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him".\n\nIn a positive review, Rolling Stone magazine's Rob Sheffield called the album a "more painful, honest and vital record" that is on-par or better than Eminem's 2002 album The Eminem Show. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as "musically white-hot, dense, and dramatic" and said that "his flow is so good, his wordplay so sharp, it seems churlish to wish that he addressed something other than his long-standing obsessions and demons". The Daily Telegraph commended its honest depiction of Eminem's drug addiction and overuse. Although he found its concept "spotty", Vibe's Benjamin Meadows-Ingram praised Eminem's lyricism, writing that "Em works wonders with words, expanding the boundaries of the art of rap itself  the composition is experimental and abstract, a master toying with form". At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nRetrospective appraisals\nDespite the lukewarm reviews at its release, the album gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of Eminem's classic albums. Mark Batson, one of the co-producers with Dr. Dre, said: "When we made Relapse with Eminem, it was not well received at the moment but now it is considered to be a classic. That’s how it goes."\n\nMitch Findlay from HotNewHipHop touted Relapse as Eminem's strongest project after The Eminem Show: "Relapse is probably the strongest of Eminem’s post-comeback catalog, largely in part to some excellent production from Dr. Dre, Dawaun Parker, and Mike Elizondo. Plus, Em seems to be in the zone here, especially when it comes to his flow. The concept, in which he embodies a depraved, accented serial killer, can be a little tiresome, but it also leads to a gratuitous bout of lyrical and hilarious Grand-Guignol." He singled out "Hello", "Beautiful" and "Deja Vu" as highlights. In 2019, Findlay included "Same Song and Dance" and "Music Box" on his "Dr. Dre's Top 10 Most Haunting Beats". Complex magazine's "The 100 Best Eminem Song" ranks "Stay Wide Awake" at number 86, "Elevator" at number 81, "My Darling" at number 79, "Underground" at number 74, "3 a.m." at number 67, "Insane" at number 27, and "Déjà Vu" at number 20.\n\nDrew Landry from DJ Booth called Relapse a "dark, disturbing and often hilarious album" and said: "Relapse sounds like a “how many violent dick jokes can I shout before someone tries to decapitate me” science experiment. If you simply sit back and embrace the depravity, though, it's oddly glorious. Eminem wasn't trying to make radio hits nor was he trying to inspire fans; he just wanted to gross us all out. And in that regard, holy shit does he succeed.". He singled out "Insane", "Stay Wide Awake", "Same Song & Dance", "Medicine Ball" and "3 a.m" as the 5 most disgusting songs on the album.\n\nPatrick Bierut from UDiscoverMusic named Relapse "the true marvel Of Eminem’s sinister return to hip-hop" and said "Relapse remains one of the most overlooked releases not only of Eminem’s career, but the mid-to-late 00s. Not only is it the Eminem album in which Dr. Dre had the truest hand in production, it’s also the most remarkable demonstration of his raw ability to rap better than almost anyone else. Due to its divisive content, however, Relapse doesn’t get enough credit for being the marvel it truly is."\n\nSpin also included some songs of the album on the top 100 of All 289 Eminem Songs, Ranked article, included "Déjà Vu" at 36 position, "Crack a Bottle" at number 48, "Beautiful" at number 62, "3 a.m" at number 68, "Elevator" at number 76, "Stay Wide Awake" at number 79 and "Underground" at number 82. HipHopDX called Relapse a "horrorcore masterpiece" and said: "the record stands as an artistic achievement that further solidifies Eminem as one of the greatest, most creative MCs to ever pick up a microphone. The article goes on to reflect the changing fan sentiment toward the album, stating that it took "years to uncover its brilliance".\n\nEminem's thoughts on the album\nOn his following album Recovery (2010), Eminem made reference to Relapse and criticizes it in the second verse of the song "Not Afraid": "In fact, let's be honest/That last Relapse CD was 'ehh'/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going back to that now".\n\nHe slowed down his feelings about the album after that saying "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That was one of those instances where I got in a zone, like, "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q&A with Rolling Stone saying "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.\n\nIn 2013, Eminem also addressed the mindstate he had while working on 2009's Relapse saying: "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I was still trying to figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." and reiterated his feeling about the album "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through to be able to make Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again."\n\nAbout the accents he used on the album: "I recorded at least 50 to 60 songs for that album and on each one I would get a little more drastic with the accents, trying to bend the words and make them rhyme in ways they wouldn’t if you just said them regular. It was this gradual thing and I didn’t even realize how accent-heavy the album got. Paul  didn’t realize it either until he went and played the music for somebody at Interscope and they were like, “Why is he doing all those accents?” So yeah, I don't know how much replay value that album has." He reitrates his statement in 2018: "I have made albums that definitely, probably would not be at the top of my list — Encore, Relapse — which I believe Encore is a better album than Relapse. Relapse is something I went back to and cringed at. Like, ‘Jesus Christ, I didn’t realize I was doing that many accents."\n\nOn his album Revival (2017), Eminem also made references to Relapse especially on the closing song "Arose": "I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse/ With Recovery, Mathers LP2/ Help propel me to victory laps/ Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past".\n\nIn 2020, Eminem looks back positively on the album for the 11th anniversary of its release. Eminem also emulates his Relapse rap style in Music to be Murdered By: Side B (Deluxe Edition) on the song "Discombobulated"\n\nCommercial performance\nOne of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse was the top-selling hip hop album of the year. Upon its release, the album debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 608,000 copies in its first week. In Canada, the album sold 64,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. By the end of 2009, the album had sold 180,000 physical units in Canada, making it the ninth best-selling physical album in Canada of 2009. Outside of North America, Relapse managed to reach the number one spot in its first week in various other countries including Australia, France, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand, while climbing into the Top 5 in many other countries, including Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. In its second week the album stayed at number one and sold a further 211,000 copies, taking its total to 819,000 to become the fifth best-seller of the year. In the third week, Relapse dropped to number two and sold another 141,000 copies, bringing the total U.S. sales to 962,000, Relapse dropped to number three in its fourth week, selling 87,000 copies for a total of 1,049,000 in the U.S. The next week, Relapse went down to number four and sold 72,000 copies.] In its sixth week, the album was at number five and sold another 47,000 copies, pushing its total sales to 1,169,000.] It dropped down to the number nine in its seventh week, selling 39,000 copies and taking its total U.S. sales up to 1,207,000 copies.] In its eighth week, it remained at number nine and sold a further 34,000 copies for a total of 1,241,000.\n\nRelapse became the best selling rap album of 2009.

99	4	Curtain Call 2	2022-08-05	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/29000b0342a5ac39a538750bc3684295/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Curtain Call 2 is the second greatest hits album by American rapper  Eminem, released on August 5, 2022, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. A double album, it is a successor of his previous greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits, which was issued in 2005. The compilation covers the most recent years of Eminem's career, since his return to music from his hiatus, starting from the release of Relapse in 2009. The album also includes three new songs, "The King and I" featuring CeeLo Green (featured in the soundtrack of the film Elvis), "From the D 2 the LBC" featuring Snoop Dogg, and "Is This Love ('09)" featuring 50 Cent.\n\nBackground and promotion\nCurtain Call 2 was first hinted at by  Eminem in a tweet promoting the single "From the D 2 the LBC" on June 24, 2022, in which he included a hashtag with the album's name.  Eminem officially announced the album and its release date via social media on July 11. On July 19, the album was made available for preorder through Eminem's website along with several merch bundles and limited edition vinyl. On August 2, the album's track listing was unveiled.\n\nCover art\nOn July 11, 2022, Eminem revealed the album's cover art on Twitter. The artwork emulates classic pinball machine-style artwork and contains many hidden Easter eggs as well as references to his previous albums. Some of the references include a fighter jet from Kamikaze and Eminem's childhood home from The Marshall Mathers LP 2.\n\nCritical reception\nDrew Millard at Pitchfork felt that the album "collects some nice singles, but mostly feels like the portrait of a wayward artist who's spent the last 13 years going in every direction. Robin Murray at Clash found the album "bold in its intention, an attempt to broaden the scope of Eminem's career, and shuffle away from the fixation on his tabloid-baiting peak. Placed side by side, however, there's simply no comparison.\n\nCommercial performance\nThe album debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200, earning 43,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It is Eminem's 12th US top-10 album, and first since The Slim Shady LP not to reach number one, thus ending Eminem's streak of number-one albums at ten. Curtain Call 2 was the best-selling album of the week in pure sales, with 18,000 copies sold. It also debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.	f
100	4	The Marshall Mathers LP	2001-01-01	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/c44c3169c7672d23bd2b1d02f5d25325/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	The Marshall Mathers LP is the thrid studio album by American rapper  Eminem, released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and  Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including  Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip-hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing  Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised  Eminem's lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles "The Real Slim Shady", "The Way I Am", "Stan", "I'm Back" and "Bitch Please II". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while "The Real Slim Shady" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album's sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann "Kim" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, "I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The "free" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to "map out" each song. He described himself as a "studio rat" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from "fucking around" in the studio; "Marshall Mathers" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while "Criminal" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. "Kill You" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n"Kim" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote "Kim" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. The song "Stan" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for "Stan" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard "Stan" and enjoyed it, and observed, "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote "The Way I Am" as his way of saying, "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs "liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the atmosphere of "Amityville". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem's major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics " the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to "dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, "Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Kill You"), the relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan", "I'm Back", and "Marshall Mathers"), his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"), his drug use ("Drug Ballad", "The Kids"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am", "Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes ("Criminal"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song "Criminal" features the line "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for "encourag violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. Eminem noted that he began using the word "faggot" more frequently when "people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse", but added, "I think it's hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, "Kill You", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper's first album, nightmares of "ladies' screams", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and "notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers'. The six-and-a-half minute long "Stan" samples Dido's "Thank You" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On "Who Knew", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem's response ranges oscillates from "smart-ass ('Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?') to smart ('Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?')."Who Knew" is followed by the "Steve Berman" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about "big-screen TVs, blunts, 40's, and bitches", while Eminem raps about "homosexuals and Vicodin", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n"The Way I Am" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being "pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. "The Real Slim Shady" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. "Remember Me?" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who "kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track". In the song, he states "I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image / So I promised the fuckin' critics / I wouldn't say 'fuckin' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)". Despite saying the word "fuck" one more time in "Remember Me", and three times at the beginning of "I'm Back", he does not say the word "fuckin" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song "Marshall Mathers".\n"I'm Back" features Eminem's observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he "became a commodity/'Cause I'm W-H-I-T-E". The next song, "Marshall Mathers", mocks the chorus of LFO's "Summer Girls", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. "Drug Ballad" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him "sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you". "Amityville" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. "Bitch Please II" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n"Kim", the prequel to "97 Bonnie and Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" "Kim" is followed by "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 "runs rampant" on the track. "Criminal" features production from F.B.T., which consists of "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...''. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that "half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP "resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like "ass", "bitch", "goddamn", and "shit" were uncensored. However, on the track "The Real Slim Shady", the words "bitch" and "shit" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs "Kill You", "Drug Ballad" and "Bitch Please II" are written as "**** You", "Ballad" and "***** Please II" on the back cover of the album. The song "Kim" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed "The Kids".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words "kids" and "Columbine" from the line, "I take seven  from , stand them all in line" from "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song "Rap God" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line "It doesn't matter  faggot" was also censored from "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album's first single, "The Real Slim Shady", became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. "The Way I Am", which was released as the album's second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. "Stan", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem's best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine's Touré applauded Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied lyrical style on what is a "car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem's startlingly intense vision of "rap's self-consciousness" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and "gruelling assault course of lyrical genius" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper's consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him "exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit", while declaring the album "a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is "indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was "mixed", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem's "verbal skills and transgressive humor" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, "docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem's "vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults" would "almost grow tedious if he weren't as inventive as he is tasteless." Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem's disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: "The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan's Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem's best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it "delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre." According to Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also "remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, "At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem's albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, "The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that "Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains "one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as "a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album's impact on white rappers, saying, "For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine's revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. Popdose listed The Marshall Mathers LP as the 10th best album of the decade. Spinner ranked the album at 22 on its Best Albums of the 2000s list. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it at number 1 on their list of "The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers". In 2015, the album was ranked number 81 by About.com on their list of 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums of All Time. In 2020, The Marshall Mathers LP was included at the 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list of Stacker, being ranked at 69. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for "promot violence of the most degrading kind against women", labeling him as "a rap singer who advocates murder and rape". She specifically cited lyrics from "Kill You", explaining, "He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has "long been a vocal supporter of free speech", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper "authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to "I'm Back" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, "Of course I'd heard of Elton John, but I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, "Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first" from "The Real Slim Shady", calling the rapper's claim "disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.\n\nIn 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song "Pulsion".	f

The album also received positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success. It debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 and US Top Country Albums charts, earning 265,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.\n\nThe double album was released on January 8, 2021 via Big Loud Records and Republic Records on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The production on the album was handled by Joey Moi, Jacob Durrett, Charlie Handsome, Matt Dragstrem and Dave Cohen. It also features guest appearances by Chris Stapleton and Ben Burgess.\n\nDangerous was preceded by the release of two singles: "More Than My Hometown", and "7 Summers"; and six promotional singles: "Cover Me Up", "This Bar", "Heartless" (Wallen Album Mix)", "Somebody's Problem", "Still Goin' Down", and "Livin' the Dream".\n\nWallen stated: "The 'double album' idea started off as just a joke between me and my manager because we had accumulated so many songs over the past couple of years. Then quarantine hit, and we realized it might actually be possible to have enough time to make it happen. I also ended up writing quite a few more songs during the quarantine with some of my good buddies. I also wanted the songs to speak to multiple phases of life and have multiple different sounds based on my influences and based on what I enjoy."\n\nShortly before the release of the album, several CDs were erroneously put up for sale at certain Walmart locations in the United States. This prompted several consumers to leak clips of unreleased songs, to which Wallen responded by saying "If anyone’s gonna leak my music, it should be me" and releasing "leaks" of unreleased songs himself. He also urged his fans to buy the physical release at Target instead, adding: "I don’t shop at Walmart anyway. I also gave Target two extra songs, so if you’re going to buy my album physically, go to Target, baby".\n\nWalmart responded to the issue with this statement provided to the Rolling Stone: "We are deeply apologetic to Morgan for this unfortunate situation. We appreciate Morgan as an artist and understand his frustration and disappointment. We have protocols in place to help ensure new albums are not sold before the release date, yet in this instance his album made its way to the shelf in a handful of stores early. We're actively removing any albums remaining on the shelves in those stores to hold until the official release date, and taking additional precautionary measures for the future."\n\nDangerous: The Double Album debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 and US Top Country Albums charts, earning 265,000 album-equivalent units (including 74,000 copies as pure album sales) in its first week, according to MRC Data. This became Wallen's first US #1 debut and his second on the latter. The album also accumulated a total of 240.18 million on-demand streams of the album’s songs, becoming the largest streaming week ever for a country album. This more than doubles the record set by Luke Combs's What You See Is What You Get. In its second week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning an additional 159,000 units making it the first country album to spend two weeks at #1 since Chris Stapleton's Traveller in 2015 and the first country set to spend its first two weeks at #1 since Luke Bryan's Kill the Lights that year. In its third week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning 130,000 more units. In its fourth week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning 149,000 units. It received a 14 percent increase from the previous week, despite the nationwide removal of Wallen's music throughout radio stations in the United States following his use of a racial slur outside of his Nashville home on February 2, 2021. It concurrently became the first country album to spend its first four weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart since Shania Twain's Up! did so in January 2003. In addition, it later extended its run with a fifth and sixth week at the top, marking the longest run atop the charts for a country album since The Chase in 1992. The album eventually spent a total of ten weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200 and ended up becoming the best selling album for the first half of 2021. As of September 2021, the album has earned 2,539,000 album-equivalent units and has sold 267,000 copies in the United States.	f

In its second week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning an additional 159,000 units making it the first country album to spend two weeks at #1 since Chris Stapleton's Traveller in 2015 and the first country set to spend its first two weeks at #1 since Luke Bryan's Kill the Lights that year. In its third week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning 130,000 more units. In its fourth week, the album remained at #1 on the chart, earning 149,000 units. It received a 14 percent increase from the previous week, despite the nationwide removal of Wallen's music throughout radio stations in the United States following his use of a racial slur outside of his Nashville home on February 2, 2021. It concurrently became the first country album to spend its first four weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart since Shania Twain's Up! did so in January 2003. In addition, it later extended its run with a fifth and sixth week at the top, marking the longest run atop the charts for a country album since The Chase in 1992. The album eventually spent a total of ten weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200 and ended up becoming the best selling album for the first half of 2021. As of September 2021, the album has earned 2,539,000 album-equivalent units and has sold 267,000 copies in the United States.	f

The album also received positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success. It debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 and US Top Country Albums charts, earning 265,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.\n\nThe double album was released on January 8, 2021 via Big Loud Records and Republic Records on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The production on the album was handled by Joey Moi, Jacob Durrett, Charlie Handsome, Matt Dragstrem and Dave Cohen. It also features guest appearances by Chris Stapleton and Ben Burgess.\n\nDangerous was preceded by the release of two singles: "More Than My Hometown", and "7 Summers"; and six promotional singles: "Cover Me Up", "This Bar", "Heartless" (Wallen Album Mix)", "Somebody's Problem", "Still Goin' Down", and "Livin' the Dream".\n\nWallen stated: "The 'double album' idea started off as just a joke between me and my manager because we had accumulated so many songs over the past couple of years. Then quarantine hit, and we realized it might actually be possible to have enough time to make it happen. I also ended up writing quite a few more songs during the quarantine with some of my good buddies. I also wanted the songs to speak to multiple phases of life and have multiple different sounds based on my influences and based on what I enjoy."\n\nShortly before the release of the album, several CDs were erroneously put up for sale at certain Walmart locations in the United States. This prompted several consumers to leak clips of unreleased songs, to which Wallen responded by saying "If anyone’s gonna leak my music, it should be me" and releasing "leaks" of unreleased songs himself. He also urged his fans to buy the physical release at Target instead, adding: "I don’t shop at Walmart anyway. I also gave Target two extra songs, so if you’re going to buy my album physically, go to Target, baby".\n\nWalmart responded to the issue with this statement provided to the Rolling Stone: "We are deeply apologetic to Morgan for this unfortunate situation. We appreciate Morgan as an artist and understand his frustration and disappointment. We have protocols in place to help ensure new albums are not sold before the release date, yet in this instance his album made its way to the shelf in a handful of stores early. We're actively removing any albums remaining on the shelves in those stores to hold until the official release date, and taking additional precautionary measures for the future."\n\nDangerous: The Double Album debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 and US Top Country Albums charts, earning 265,000 album-equivalent units (including 74,000 copies as pure album sales) in its first week, according to MRC Data.

The album also accumulated a total of 240.18 million on-demand streams of the album’s songs, becoming the largest streaming week ever for a country album.

The album also received positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success. It debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200 and US Top Country Albums charts, earning 265,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.\n\nThe double album was released on January 8, 2021 via Big Loud Records and Republic Records on CD, vinyl, and digital download. The production on the album was handled by Joey Moi, Jacob Durrett, Charlie Handsome, Matt Dragstrem and Dave Cohen. It also features guest appearances by Chris Stapleton and Ben Burgess.\n\nDangerous was preceded by the release of two singles: "More Than My Hometown", and "7 Summers"; and six promotional singles: "Cover Me Up", "This Bar", "Heartless" (Wallen Album Mix)", "Somebody's Problem", "Still Goin' Down", and "Livin' the Dream".\n\nWallen stated: "The 'double album' idea started off as just a joke between me and my manager because we had accumulated so many songs over the past couple of years. Then quarantine hit, and we realized it might actually be possible to have enough time to make it happen. I also ended up writing quite a few more songs during the quarantine with some of my good buddies. I also wanted the songs to speak to multiple phases of life and have multiple different sounds based on my influences and based on what I enjoy."\n\nShortly before the release of the album, several CDs were erroneously put up for sale at certain Walmart locations in the United States. This prompted several consumers to leak clips of unreleased songs, to which Wallen responded by saying "If anyone’s gonna leak my music, it should be me" and releasing "leaks" of unreleased songs himself. He also urged his fans to buy the physical release at Target instead, adding: "I don’t shop at Walmart anyway. I also gave Target two extra songs, so if you’re going to buy my album physically, go to Target, baby".\n\nWalmart responded to the issue with this statement provided to the Rolling Stone: "We are deeply apologetic to Morgan for this unfortunate situation.

We were listening to a massive South African playlist for months, straight to where we became big fans of the sound and culture. And that was an important part, because we wanted to go inside their world to get an organic sound, sonically and emotionally."\n\nOn February 18, 2018, the soundtrack debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 154,000 equivalent album sales. It is Lamar’s fourth album in a row to debut in the top spot during the first week of its release.	f

During the Rolling Stone interview, she and Punch spoke in length about the album's composition. The inspiration in question was eclectic, drawing from jazz, alternative rock, "traditional" R&B, country, and hip hop. About the wide range of genres incorporated into the album, SZA said she did not care if her production choices made the album sound incohesive, because to her, "if you sound like you, your shit’s going to be cohesive. Period." Punch commented: "It's a new chapter. She's not scared to try certain things now."\n\nSOS has received widespread critical acclaim upon its release.

The tracks, like his third studio album, draw inspiration from Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, the initial part of his 14th-century masterpiece, Divine Comedy, and fit into the circles of gluttony, limbo, violence, and the outward ‘ascent’ respectively. They were originally intended for inclusion on Unreal Unearth but did not make the final cut for various reasons as stated by the artist in a newsletter to his fans. Hozier first teased the release of the EP on February 20, 2024 during an interview with El Camino, a Mexican radio station, while he was on the Mexican leg of his Unreal Unearth tour. The release date was confirmed on March 6, 2024, during an interview with Chris Black and Jon Stewart for their podcast How Long Gone episode 614. The final tracklist was confirmed via that artist’s social accounts and a newsletter sent to his fans.	f

It was released on March 27th, 2020 by Warner Records. Lipa began working on the album in early 2018, enlisting writers and producers such as Jeff Bhasker, Ian Kirkpatrick, Stuart Price, The Monsters and the Strangerz and others in order to create a pop record with a "nostalgic" and electronic feel.\n\nThree singles and one promotional single were released from the album. "Don't Start Now" was released as the album's lead single on November 1st, 2019. The song attained both critical and commercial success, becoming her seventh top 10 entry on the UK Singles Chart and second top 10 entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 2 on the latter. The album's title track was released as a promotional single on December 13th, 2019.

"Break My Heart" was released as the third single on March 25th, 2020 and it samples the melody from "Need You Tonight" by INXS. In order to promote the album, Lipa announced the "Future Nostalgia" Tour, consisting of 24 shows in Europe and commencing in January 2021.\n\nMusically, "Future Nostalgia" has been described by Lipa as a "dancercise class". She stated that its songs will incorporate genres of disco and pop, inspired by artists such as Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Moloko, Blondie, and Outkast.\n\n"Future Nostalgia" was originally scheduled to be released April 3rd, 2020 and the tour to commence later in April. However, due to the spread of coronavirus, the European tour was postponed to January 2021, and the album was brought forward a week as Lipa wanted to spread happiness in such a dark time. Following her debut's complete edition, Lipa teased a future re-release of Future Nostalgia near the end of 2020, which will feature tracks that didn't originally make the record.\n\n"Future Nostalgia" has received a nomination for Album Of The Year, as well as Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2021 Grammys.	f

The song was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr., Sarah Hudson and Stephen Kozmeniuk. The production was handled by Koz and Stuart Price, and stemmed from a Roland VP-330 synthesizer sample played by the former. The song is an electro-disco and nu-disco song with several disco tropes. It incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop-funk, power pop and space rock, as well as 1970s, 1980s and 1990s pop and R&B styles. The lyrics describe the idea of "levitating" when falling in love, with several outer space references.\n\n\n"Levitating" reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lipa's seventh top five single in the UK and second in the US. Despite not peaking at number one in the United States, "Levitating" was named the number one song of 2021, becoming the fourth single to accomplish this feat and the first single to do so since Lifehouse's "Hanging by a Moment" in 2001. It also ranks in the top 40 of its All-Time list. This song is also the longest running top 10 song by a female artist in Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the second song to spend 40 weeks in the region. It also reached number two on the Billboard Global 200 chart. The song was awarded a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\n\n"Levitating" was promoted with the release of two music videos, one for each of its respective remixes. The Will Hooper-directed music video for the Blessed Madonna's remix was filmed in London and Atlanta and has a theme of "love conquers all". It sees many people under the influence of a mysterious planet, and being obsessed with a maze-like symbol. The DaBaby remix received a music video that was directed by Warren Fu and created in partnership with social media platform TikTok. The video is centered around Lipa and DaBaby dancing in an art deco-styled elevator, with many TikTok users in the cast. Lipa promoted the single with live performances on the Graham Norton Show, at the American Music Awards of 2020, and on Saturday Night Live.	f

Describing the album as having “winter vibes”. On April 25, 2023 he confirmed that the recording of the Deluxe version was done, along with a presave link. The exact release date and tracklist of the album are still to be announced.\n\nOn May 2, 2023 Noah shared a TikTok in which he describes the process of making the Deluxe edition, opening up about the anxiety and fear of failure that having to follow up his biggest success caused him. He writes “I was completely lost in how to continue telling this story”.\n\nKahan decided to go back to the place that inspired him to make Stick Season in the first place: his home town. However, when he got there he discovered that it did not feel the same -he felt like a tourist. His home now served as a reminder of his self-described “impending failure”, making him feel even worse than he already did.\n\nNot being able to continue with this negativity, Noah describes letting go of his self-imposed pressure and anxiety, deciding instead to make this very letting go the theme of the deluxe album. He describes it best himself, when he talks about the Deluxe in comparison to the original Stick Season album:\n\n“Stick Season is a record that at times is full of bitterness and resentment towards those who left a place that the narrator could not. What if the Deluxe is about letting go of that resentment, and finding peace in sticking around?”	f

Throughout this crisis, I’ve spoken to friends who say they feel similarly, like they’re back in high school again, back with their old selves.

Alongside prominent production from the album's executive producers Drake and 40, further contributors include T-Minus, Chantal Kreviazuk, Boi-1da, Illangelo, Jamie xx, Supa Dups, Just Blaze, Chase N. Cashe, and Doc McKinney.\n\nPrior to Take Care, Drake released Thank Me Later, which experienced positive critical success, but left him feeling disjointed about the album's musical content. Expressing a desire to reunite with 40, his long-time producer who featured in parts on Thank Me Later, the duo worked extensively on the new album once recording sessions began in 2010. Drake's vocals on the album feature emotional crooning, alto vocals, a guttural cadence, a melodic flow, and a larger emphasis on singing than on Thank Me Later. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed that the album is called Take Care because "I get to take my time this go-round ".\n\nThe album also expands on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. It incorporates several elements that have come to define Drake's sound, including minimalist R&B influences, existential subject matter, and alternately sung and rapped vocals. It features a mixture of braggadocio and emotional lyrics, exploring themes of fame, romance, and wealth. The album also highlights other topics, such as Drake's relationships with friends and family, as well as touching on sex and narcissism.\n\nDespite leaking online nine days before its scheduled release, Take Care debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 631,000 copies in its first week. It has been certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Four of the album's singles peaked in the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100: "Headlines", "Make Me Proud", "The Motto" and "Take Care". The album received positive reviews, with praise for its expansive production and emotional themes. It was named one of 2011's best albums, and later one of the best albums of the 2010s, by several publications. It won Drake his first Grammy Award, winning Best Rap Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.	f

It was released on May 17, 2015, through Fueled by Ramen. The album is primarily an alternative hip hop, electropop, and reggae album with influences of hip hop, rock, and pop. Lyrically, the album incorporates themes of mental health, doubt, and religion. It contains the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride", both of which reached the top-five on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBlurryface was well-received by critics, who complimented its themes and musical diversity. It is considered to be the band's breakthrough album, becoming their first and only release to reach number one on the Billboard 200, thus far. The album has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States as of April 2017. In 2018, Blurryface became the first album in the digital era to have every track receive at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. On May 17, 2019, it reached the milestone of being on the Billboard 200 chart for four consecutive years, never leaving the chart up until that point. It is also the most-streamed rock album in history, with over 5.8 billion plays.	f

It is the band's first studio album in three years, after the breakthrough success of their previous album, Blurryface (2015).

The album is also the first release of the newly revived Elektra Music Group.\n\nThe album was preceded by the release of four singles. The first two, "Jumpsuit" and "Nico and the Niners", were both released on July 11, 2018. The third single, "Levitate", was released on August 8, 2018.

Critics noted its return to the "playful alt-pop sound" of Vessel (2013), and a departure from the darker approach of its predecessors Blurryface (2015) and Trench (2018). The album has also been described as alternative rock, pop, rock, rap and synthpop, with elements of electro.\n\nThe album's title is a play on "scaled back and isolated", a phrase frontman Tyler Joseph associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the music produced at the time. On an interview with Sirius XM, he stated that he wanted to "lean into being aware that things are scaled back and that we're isolated". Despite that, Joseph's goal was to create an album that contrasts this very idea and that conveys the opposite of it. The album title is also an anagram of "Clancy is dead", a reference to the protagonist of Trench, the band has however neither described this as coincidental nor declined to comment on this subject. The title's initials appear on the cover art for their 2020 single "Christmas Saves the Year", on which the sentence "SAI is propaganda" is written in purple on one of the wrapped gifts.\n\nThe cover artwork for Scaled and Icy was designed by Brandon Rike, who also designed the cover art for Trench and Blurryface. It features a scaled, teal dragon breathing yellow fire over a pink background, as well as a psi symbol in the top right corner. The dragon is named Trash, and represents "inspiration, fear, and magic"; Joseph explained that he wanted to "tie the songs to something as powerful as that". The creature was originally drawn by British illustrator Walter Crane in a children's book from the 1860s (the artwork is in the public domain, allowing the band to use it in the album cover). Its usage was also inspired by a small dragon figurine Joseph keeps in his home studio, with Joseph revealing to BBC Radio 1 that it represented an idea that if he were to focus on a single detail of a small room, "then that detail can then come to life".\n\nAlthough a departure from the conceptual narrative found on Trench, the band largely continues to examine serious themes on Scaled and Icy despite its upbeat sound. Joseph explained that the contrast was deliberate, stating that "as you dive into lyrics, a lot of times it's asking some pretty heavy questions and addressing some pretty heavy things". Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic described the album as "a snapshot of the emotional highs and lows of quarantine life", while Augusta Battoclette of Alternative Press noted the themes of "anxiety, doubt and the need to keep your loved ones close".\n\nThe album was preceded by the singles "Shy Away", and "Choker", and "Saturday", "The Outside" was chosen as the fourth single later on.\n\nScaled and Icy received generally positive reviews from music critics overall. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 70, based on 9 critical reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". The album peaked at no. 03 in both the US and the UK. At the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, it won the Top Rock Album category.	f

The album was self-released on July 11, 2011, originally available both in its digital and physical form, but was discontinued once the band signed with their record label, Fueled By Ramen.\nFive of the tracks from Regional at Best — "Guns for Hands", "Holding on to You", "Ode to Sleep", "Car Radio", and "Trees" — were re-recorded and released on Vessel. In April 2013, prior to the release of Vessel, a re-recorded and altered version of "Lovely" was released as an exclusive promotional single in Japan and featured on the bonus track edition of Vessel. "Glowing Eyes", "Kitchen Sink" and "Forest" were not re-recorded but were released, as they appear on Regional at Best, on the UK bonus edition of Vessel. As such, only five of the tracks from Regional at Best are available to purchase in the US, and six tracks — "Slowtown", "Anathema", "Ruby", "Be Concerned", "Clear", and "Two"  (digital fan-club bonus track) — are not available for purchase anywhere.	f

It was released under license to YSL Records and 300 Entertainment on May 10, 2024.

It arrives two months after the original and includes eight additional tracks.\n\nIn the lead-up to the album, Gunna previewed countless songs, so when many of those songs weren’t on the standard edition, fans quickly assumed that Gunna was planning to release a deluxe edition.\n\nOn July 22, Gunna posted the deluxe’s artwork and revamped tracklist.	f

The Atlanta MC has also claimed that it represents an alternate identity, a chance to step away, if only momentarily, from the franchises that made his name, Drip Season and Drip or Drown. Thankfully for Gunna fans, however, the MC we get in WUNNA isn’t all that different from the man who taught us the meaning of drip.\n\nAcross beats from a veritable wish list of can’t-miss producers including Wheezy, Turbo The Great and Tay Keith, Gunna raps in effortless non sequitur about clothing, jewellery and women. He’s joined by frequent collaborators Lil Baby, Young Thug and Travis Scott, and also Roddy Ricch, who guests on COOLER THAN A BITCH, a song dedicated to anyone mistakenly believing that they’re operating on the same plane as he is. Across 18 tracks, WUNNA is everything fans could have wanted from an MC who’s dedicated his career to establishing himself as a trendsetter. In fact, the only place the drip is missing is in the title.	f

SZA)", "You Right" with The Weeknd, "Need to Know", "Woman" and "Get Into It (Yuh)". The first four songs all charted within the top 15 of both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.

Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. "Go Your Own Way", "Don't Stop", "Dreams", and "You Make Loving Fun" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\n\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.\n\nIn July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's tenth album was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in 1976. The record's hit single "Rhiannon" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.\n\nPress intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the "tremendous emotional sacrifices" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.	f

The album was issued only in the UK, but became available in the US as an import.\n\nLong out of print, Greatest Hits was replaced on compact disc by the 2002 compilation The Best of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac on the Sony International label, which now owns the Columbia/CBS catalogue. The album was however reissued on vinyl in 2010.\n\nA similar release with the same title and same cover was released by Sony BMG in 1989, but consisted of the tracks from The Pious Bird of Good Omen plus "Shake Your Moneymaker" and "Love That Burns". This release should not be confused with the identically titled but entirely different 1988 release on Warner Brothers, Greatest Hits. That compilation concentrates exclusively on post-1975 material and has no tracks in common with the 1971 Greatest Hits nor the 1988 variant.	f

The tracks were recorded on August 29, 1977, at the the Forum in Inglewood, California on the Rumours Tour. The set list comprises tracks from 1975's Fleetwood Mac and 1977's Rumours, with the exception of "Oh Well", released as a single in 1969. All recordings were previously unreleased aside from "Gold Dust Woman", which appeared on the 2021 reissue of Live.	f

When they were led by Bob Welch they often flirted with pop, even recording the first version of the unabashedly smooth and sappy "Sentimental Lady," which would later be one of the defining soft rock hits of the late '70s. Still, there's no denying that 1975's Fleetwood Mac represents not just the rebirth of the band, but in effect a second debut for the group -- the introduction of a band that would dominate the sound of American and British mainstream pop for the next seven years. In fact, in retrospect, it's rather stunning how thoroughly Buckingham and Nicks, who had previously recorded as a duo and were romantically entangled in the past, overtook the British blues band. As soon as the Californian duo came onboard, Fleetwood Mac turned into a West Coast pop/rock band, transforming the very identity of the band and pushing the band's other songwriter, keyboardist Christine McVie, to a kindred soft rock sound. It could have all been too mellow if it weren't for the nervy, restless spirit of Buckingham, whose insistent opener, "Monday Morning," sets the tone for the rest of the album, as well the next few years of the group's career. Surging with a pushily melodic chorus and a breezy Californian feel, the song has little to do with anything the Mac had done before this, and it is a positively brilliant slice of pop songwriting, simultaneously urgent and timeless. After that barnstorming opener, Buckingham lies back a bit, contributing only two other songs -- a cover of Richard Curtis' "Blue Letter," the second best up-tempo song here, and the closer, "I'm So Afraid" -- while the rest of the album is given over to the wily spirits of Nicks and McVie, whose singles "Rhiannon," "Say You Love Me," and "Over My Head" deservedly made this into a blockbuster. But a bandmember's contribution can never be reduced to his own tracks, and Buckingham not only gives the production depth, he motivates the rest of the band, particularly Nicks and McVie, to do great work, not just on the hit singles but the album tracks that give this record depth. It was diverse without being forced, percolating with innovative ideas, all filtered through an accessible yet sophisticated sensibility. While Rumours had more hits and Tusk was an inspired work of mad genius, Fleetwood Mac wrote the blueprint for Californian soft rock of the late '70s and was the standard the rest were judged by. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi	f

Records. This studio effort's soft rock sound stood in stark contrast to its more experimental predecessor, 1979's Tusk. \nAfter the completion of the worldwide Tusk Tour, the band took a year-long hiatus. During this time, Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, and Lindsey Buckingham had each started solo careers, Nicks to multi-platinum, number-one success with 1981's Bella Donna. Unlike the band's previous four albums, Fleetwood wanted the band to record Mirage outside of Los Angeles; he also sought to eschew the experimentation found on Tusk and instead replicate the commercial appeal of Rumours.	f

His partner, Stevie Nicks, had been missing in action from the group since 1990, and while both joined the reunited group in 1997 for a tour and live album (The Dance), not to mention Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, it had been a long, long time since the two made new music for the Mac. They were lured back into the fold for...well, the specifics -- whether money, prestige, status, publicity, or creativity -- don't really matter, since the end result is the same, it's that Buckingham and Nicks have come home. This doesn't qualify as a full-fledged Fleetwood reunion, since Christine McVie isn't here, choosing to opt out of this high-profile return to the breach (although her playing is occasionally heard on the album). This results in a record that never quite sounds like Fleetwood Mac. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are so grateful to have the two superstars back in the group that they cede ground to Buckingham and Nicks, who never collaborate as much as share space. Each singer/songwriter is given nine songs apiece, a move which, in itself, would not necessarily be a problem, but over the course of this lengthy, lengthy album, the evenhandedness starts to give the impression that this is two solo albums presented as a group effort. An assessment that's a little harsh, since the group can still conjure echoes of their classic sound, but the division of work is so deliberate and their work so dissimilar, it can't help but feel like two separate pieces pushed together to make the whole. Which is where Christine McVie becomes a critical factor. While never a star like Nicks, nor possessing the mad genius of Buckingham, McVie was a strong, likeable songwriter whose gently melodic works balanced the extremities of her bandmates while also forcing them to choose the best material to fit the record. Add to this that Fleetwood Mac have decided to run wild with the length of a CD, producing a record that is significantly longer than the messy, chaotic Tusk, but without its inspired insanity or depth of sound and character. Here, even if most songs are in the four-minute ballpark, they all feel longer, partially because the album clocks in at nearly 80 minutes and the sequencing flows as it was designed by committee. So, Say You Will winds up occupying a strange middle ground, often feeling as if it was Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks' albums bouncing around on shuffle play, but also occasionally flashing moments that are purely, satisfyingly Fleetwood Mac. Although there are occasional misguided attempts to modernize the songs -- most notably drum loops on some of Nicks' songs -- none of the songs sound as if the band were forcing themselves to sound contemporary. Sure, it sounds commercial, but that's the band's idiom -- what's important is that it never sounds compromised, it sounds as if the band is at once trying too hard while being unwilling to sacrifice individual moments for the greater good. So, Say You Will straddles many lines at once. Nicks' material is better-realized than many of her recent albums, but Buckingham's always sounds as if it should be wilder than it is (it should all sound as unrestrained as his guitar, which is continually surprising throughout the record). It never sounds like classic Fleetwood Mac, nor does it sound modern. It often sounds like solo albums, but without the freedom that allows. Most of these problems derive merely from the length. Cut out half of the record -- have it weigh in at nine or ten songs and run no longer than 45 minutes -- and it would have been a good, solid comeback, perhaps even eclipsing the uneven Tango in the Night. But there are too many songs, simply too much to make Say You Will work, even if there is enough to admire to make you wish it did. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi	f

Sure, it sounds commercial, but that's the band's idiom -- what's important is that it never sounds compromised, it sounds as if the band is at once trying too hard while being unwilling to sacrifice individual moments for the greater good. So, Say You Will straddles many lines at once. Nicks' material is better-realized than many of her recent albums, but Buckingham's always sounds as if it should be wilder than it is (it should all sound as unrestrained as his guitar, which is continually surprising throughout the record). It never sounds like classic Fleetwood Mac, nor does it sound modern. It often sounds like solo albums, but without the freedom that allows. Most of these problems derive merely from the length. Cut out half of the record -- have it weigh in at nine or ten songs and run no longer than 45 minutes -- and it would have been a good, solid comeback, perhaps even eclipsing the uneven Tango in the Night. But there are too many songs, simply too much to make Say You Will work, even if there is enough to admire to make you wish it did. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi	f
790	32	Mystery to Me	1973-10-15	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/740bf79272291900c5e1ae95e6b2815a/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	At this point, the band was best-known as a British blues unit. Slowly but surely the band was becoming more acclimated with a production style that was reminiscent of the California pop sound. With the majority of the blues and psychedelic behind them, Mystery to Me finds Fleetwood Mac in a more ruminative vein. American guitarist Bob Welch established that path. Despite the all-encompassing ethos, Welch's songwriting skills made him walk a fine line between the mystical and the silly. But luckily most everything works here. The leadoff song, the laid-back "Emerald Eyes" matches Welch's spacey lyrics and vocals as Christine McVie provides great backing help. The album's best track, the gorgeous and lyrically strong "Hypnotized" has Welch matching an effortless, soothing croon with jazzy guitar riffs. Throughout Mystery to Me the amazing and almost telepathic drums and bass of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie give this effort more panache and muscle than was represented on this effort's predecessor, Bare Trees. The best Bob Welch offering, "Keep on Going," has a strong, soulful string arrangement and Christine McVie's customary sensual and poised vocals. The only weak spot is the ill-advised cover of "For Your Love" that's steeped in hackneyed, post-psychedelic style. Mystery to Me's interesting sound is directly attributed to the fact that it was recorded on the Rolling Stones Mobile Unit. This effort is custom-made for those who like thoughtful offerings and is a valuable set in the scheme of the band. ~ Jason Elias, Rovi	f

It was released as a single on October 4, 2019. It was released in a variety of formats, including on 7-inch vinyl, cassette and as a CD single. In its first week, it debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, for the chart dated October 19, 2019, becoming Scott's second US number-one single, following "Sicko Mode". A remix featuring Spanish singer Rosalía and American rapper Lil Baby was released on December 27, 2019, and featured on Scott and other Cactus Jack members' compilation album JackBoys (2019) on the same day, while the original release remains off the compilation. The remix version was released to Italian contemporary hit radio on January 7, 2020. The song received a nomination for Best Melodic Rap Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. The song was first used in Scott's girlfriend Kylie Jenner's "Kybrows" commercial on April 29, 2019, before Scott debuted the song during his set at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami on May 10–12, 2019. On August 31, 2019, Scott played a portion of the song at a concert that included a verse from Lil Baby, but was ultimately cut in the final version because Scott wanted to express the breakup with himself and Jenner on his own. The demo version featuring Baby leaked on December 24, 2019. Baby's verse was on the remix of the song, which is on the compilation album JackBoys. However, the original version of "Highest in the Room" did not make it onto the album. Scott officially announced the track's release through social media on September 30, posting three covers for the song as well as a pre-order link and captioning the post "See u on the 4th". A music video was released on October 4, 2019, on YouTube, directed by Dave Meyers and Travis Scott himself, while it was produced by Nathan Scherrer, Randy Donaldson, and Sam Lecca. "Highest in the Room" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated October 19, 2019, becoming Scott's second number-one single on the chart (after 2018's "Sicko Mode"), his first number-one single on its first week on the chart, and 35th single to debut at the number one position in the chart's history. "Highest in the Room" debuted atop the Streaming Songs chart with 59 million streams and debuted at number two on the Digital Songs chart with 51,000 downloads. The song fell to number six the following week on October 26, 2019. It later returned to the top 10 on the issue dated January 11, 2020 at number eight, partly charged by sales from the remix featuring Rosalia and Lil Baby. Elsewhere, in Greece the song charted at number one.	f

Initial writing and demo sessions at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham featured Cozy Powell and bootlegs exist.\n\nAlbum information\nBoth lyrically and musically, it is considered one of Sabbath's heaviest albums. Song themes vary from a computer worshipped as a god, to televangelists, to individualism and doubts about after-life.\n\nThe album was originally to be done with drummer Cozy Powell, but he was in a horse riding accident, which broke his pelvis. Dio wanted to get Simon Wright, from AC/DC and later his own band, as drummer, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. So, they called Vinny Appice to be drummer. During the sessions however, 2 unreleased songs were recorded: "The Night Life", whose riff was later used for Psychophobia on Cross Purposes; And "Bad Blood", which sounds very similar to "I" on the same album. These songs can be found, along with other demos and untitled songs on bootlegged "Complete Dehumanizer Sessions" along with the Geezer Butler Band's version of "Master of Insanity" and "Computer God", which sounds like an entirely different song.\n\n"Computer God" was the title of an unreleased song by The Geezer Butler Band, in 1986 - only the title made it to Dehumanizer. The GBB version is available as a download on Geezer Butler's website. "Master of Insanity" was also an unreleased GBB track and the Dehumanizer version is essentially a re-recording of this. (1:17 minutes of this track is available as a download on the website of Carl Sentance, erstwhile vocalist with The GBB.)\n\nAlthough the band lineup is the same as 1981's Mob Rules, the musical direction is very different - not only because of the aforementioned heaviness, but the songs are also darker, more pessimistic and more intense than in every earlier Sabbath album. It was a dramatic, and to some, welcome return from their previous album, Tyr.\n\nRonnie James Dio himself would follow this musical / lyrical direction in his next two albums with his band Dio, Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996).\n\nCommercially, this album is regarded as a resurgence for Sabbath. The album reached the Top 40 in the UK. It peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThis incarnation of Sabbath ended when Ronnie James Dio abruptly quit the band upon guitarist Tony Iommi's suggestion that the band open for Ozzy Osbourne in Costa Mesa at the end of his 1992 tour, intended to be the farewell tour. Dio and Osbourne had a history of animosity, more from Osbourne's side but certainly not one-sided, and Dio felt that Sabbath should not open for any band, much less his 'rival' (and the band's former frontman) Ozzy Osbourne. Dio's contract expired at the end of the Dehumanizer tour and he chose not to do the two Osbourne Costa Mesa shows.\n\nFor these two shows the band replaced Dio with Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford and, on the second night, Iommi, Butler and original Sabbath drummer Bill Ward joined Osbourne onstage for four songs. Halford and Dio are friends (Dio having been impressed with Halford's work ethic on the 'Stars' project) and Halford would only do the Costa Mesa shows with Dio's blessing, which he received when he spoke with Dio by phone. Both shows were recorded in their entireties and are now widely circulated as audio and video bootlegs.\n\nIt is somewhat unclear as to whether this album was supposed to be a one-off affair or the beginning of a true reunion of this Sabbath line-up. Dio's contract technically ran out at the end of the album's tour (allowing him to quit the band in response to Tony Iommi's desire to have the band open for Ozzy Osbourne) which would suggest that future albums were not meant to be. However, Iommi also formally fired the other three band members (including twice firing singer Tony Martin) which would indicate that he never really intended to bring them back. It has been suggested that the album was officially a one-off effort but that the band members would continue if they found they could co-exist well enough to do so. According to Ronnie James Dio, the band could not get along sufficiently as the members' personalities and egos had not changed over the previous decade. There were also rumors that talks of a reunion with Ozzy took place during the Dehumanizer tour; it being alleged that Iommi and Butler went so far as to discuss this with Osbourne, who ultimately backed out. It is possible these talks were used by the Osbourne camp to derail the Dehumanizer reunion.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi.\n\n\n Side one\n"Computer God" – 6:10 \n"After All (The Dead)" – 5:37 \n"TV Crimes" – 3:58 \n"Letters From Earth" – 4:12 \n"Master Of Insanity" – 5:54 \n\nSide two\n"Time Machine" – 4:10 \n"Sins Of The Father" – 4:43 \n"Too Late" – 6:54 \n"I" – 5:10 \n"Buried Alive" – 4:47 \n\nBonus track\nThe US-release added a bonus track:\n\n"Time Machine (Wayne's World Version)" – 4:18 This is the first recording of the song, specifically for the soundtrack to "Wayne's World" and ahead of the album sessions.

It was originally released independently by Smiley Miley, inc on August 30, 2015 but was later released commercially on iTunes and other streaming platforms under RCA Records on April 10, 2017.\n\nCyrus began planning the project in 2013 before Bangerz was released. Work continued into 2014 and 2015, when she befriended and began collaborating with The Flaming Lips. In addition to the psychedelic rock band, Cyrus worked with producers Mike Will Made It and Oren Yoel (with whom she had collaborated on Bangerz). The album features guest vocals by Big Sean (who had appeared on Bangerz), Sarah Barthel of Phantogram and Ariel Pink.\n\nWithout previous promotion, Cyrus announced that Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz was available for free online streaming when she hosted the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, released independently.\n\nDespite being negatively received by most of the public and critics when it was released, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz has been gaining more recognition over time. In an article for Billboard, Tatiana Cirisiano pointed out that by releasing it for free online outside her multi-album contract with RCA Records, Cyrus made "a bold and potentially lethal move for any artist today, let alone a pop star in 2015". The project was recognized for "asserting that pop stars, too, should be afforded the freedom to experiment with one-offs - while they certainly can use the 'era' model if it serves their artistry best, not every release must connote the beginning of a heavily-promoted album cycle and matching persona".	f

Initial writing and demo sessions at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham featured Cozy Powell and bootlegs exist.\n\nAlbum information\nBoth lyrically and musically, it is considered one of Sabbath's heaviest albums. Song themes vary from a computer worshipped as a god, to televangelists, to individualism and doubts about after-life.\n\nThe album was originally to be done with drummer Cozy Powell, but he was in a horse riding accident, which broke his pelvis. Dio wanted to get Simon Wright, from AC/DC and later his own band, as drummer, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. So, they called Vinny Appice to be drummer. During the sessions however, 2 unreleased songs were recorded: "The Night Life", whose riff was later used for Psychophobia on Cross Purposes; And "Bad Blood", which sounds very similar to "I" on the same album. These songs can be found, along with other demos and untitled songs on bootlegged "Complete Dehumanizer Sessions" along with the Geezer Butler Band's version of "Master of Insanity" and "Computer God", which sounds like an entirely different song.\n\n"Computer God" was the title of an unreleased song by The Geezer Butler Band, in 1986 - only the title made it to Dehumanizer. The GBB version is available as a download on Geezer Butler's website. "Master of Insanity" was also an unreleased GBB track and the Dehumanizer version is essentially a re-recording of this. (1:17 minutes of this track is available as a download on the website of Carl Sentance, erstwhile vocalist with The GBB.)\n\nAlthough the band lineup is the same as 1981's Mob Rules, the musical direction is very different - not only because of the aforementioned heaviness, but the songs are also darker, more pessimistic and more intense than in every earlier Sabbath album. It was a dramatic, and to some, welcome return from their previous album, Tyr.\n\nRonnie James Dio himself would follow this musical / lyrical direction in his next two albums with his band Dio, Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996).\n\nCommercially, this album is regarded as a resurgence for Sabbath. The album reached the Top 40 in the UK. It peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThis incarnation of Sabbath ended when Ronnie James Dio abruptly quit the band upon guitarist Tony Iommi's suggestion that the band open for Ozzy Osbourne in Costa Mesa at the end of his 1992 tour, intended to be the farewell tour. Dio and Osbourne had a history of animosity, more from Osbourne's side but certainly not one-sided, and Dio felt that Sabbath should not open for any band, much less his 'rival' (and the band's former frontman) Ozzy Osbourne. Dio's contract expired at the end of the Dehumanizer tour and he chose not to do the two Osbourne Costa Mesa shows.\n\nFor these two shows the band replaced Dio with Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford and, on the second night, Iommi, Butler and original Sabbath drummer Bill Ward joined Osbourne onstage for four songs. Halford and Dio are friends (Dio having been impressed with Halford's work ethic on the 'Stars' project) and Halford would only do the Costa Mesa shows with Dio's blessing, which he received when he spoke with Dio by phone. Both shows were recorded in their entireties and are now widely circulated as audio and video bootlegs.\n\nIt is somewhat unclear as to whether this album was supposed to be a one-off affair or the beginning of a true reunion of this Sabbath line-up. Dio's contract technically ran out at the end of the album's tour (allowing him to quit the band in response to Tony Iommi's desire to have the band open for Ozzy Osbourne) which would suggest that future albums were not meant to be. However, Iommi also formally fired the other three band members (including twice firing singer Tony Martin) which would indicate that he never really intended to bring them back. It has been suggested that the album was officially a one-off effort but that the band members would continue if they found they could co-exist well enough to do so. According to Ronnie James Dio, the band could not get along sufficiently as the members' personalities and egos had not changed over the previous decade. There were also rumors that talks of a reunion with Ozzy took place during the Dehumanizer tour; it being alleged that Iommi and Butler went so far as to discuss this with Osbourne, who ultimately backed out. It is possible these talks were used by the Osbourne camp to derail the Dehumanizer reunion.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi.\n\n\n Side one\n"Computer God" – 6:10 \n"After All (The Dead)" – 5:37 \n"TV Crimes" – 3:58 \n"Letters From Earth" – 4:12 \n"Master Of Insanity" – 5:54 \n\nSide two\n"Time Machine" – 4:10 \n"Sins Of The Father" – 4:43 \n"Too Late" – 6:54 \n"I" – 5:10 \n"Buried Alive" – 4:47 \n\nBonus track\nThe US-release added a bonus track:\n\n"Time Machine (Wayne's World Version)" – 4:18 This is the first recording of the song, specifically for the soundtrack to "Wayne's World" and ahead of the album sessions.

There were also rumors that talks of a reunion with Ozzy took place during the Dehumanizer tour; it being alleged that Iommi and Butler went so far as to discuss this with Osbourne, who ultimately backed out.

Initial writing and demo sessions at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham featured Cozy Powell and bootlegs exist.\n\nAlbum information\nBoth lyrically and musically, it is considered one of Sabbath's heaviest albums. Song themes vary from a computer worshipped as a god, to televangelists, to individualism and doubts about after-life.\n\nThe album was originally to be done with drummer Cozy Powell, but he was in a horse riding accident, which broke his pelvis. Dio wanted to get Simon Wright, from AC/DC and later his own band, as drummer, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. So, they called Vinny Appice to be drummer. During the sessions however, 2 unreleased songs were recorded: "The Night Life", whose riff was later used for Psychophobia on Cross Purposes; And "Bad Blood", which sounds very similar to "I" on the same album. These songs can be found, along with other demos and untitled songs on bootlegged "Complete Dehumanizer Sessions" along with the Geezer Butler Band's version of "Master of Insanity" and "Computer God", which sounds like an entirely different song.\n\n"Computer God" was the title of an unreleased song by The Geezer Butler Band, in 1986 - only the title made it to Dehumanizer. The GBB version is available as a download on Geezer Butler's website. "Master of Insanity" was also an unreleased GBB track and the Dehumanizer version is essentially a re-recording of this. (1:17 minutes of this track is available as a download on the website of Carl Sentance, erstwhile vocalist with The GBB.)\n\nAlthough the band lineup is the same as 1981's Mob Rules, the musical direction is very different - not only because of the aforementioned heaviness, but the songs are also darker, more pessimistic and more intense than in every earlier Sabbath album. It was a dramatic, and to some, welcome return from their previous album, Tyr.\n\nRonnie James Dio himself would follow this musical / lyrical direction in his next two albums with his band Dio, Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996).\n\nCommercially, this album is regarded as a resurgence for Sabbath. The album reached the Top 40 in the UK. It peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThis incarnation of Sabbath ended when Ronnie James Dio abruptly quit the band upon guitarist Tony Iommi's suggestion that the band open for Ozzy Osbourne in Costa Mesa at the end of his 1992 tour, intended to be the farewell tour. Dio and Osbourne had a history of animosity, more from Osbourne's side but certainly not one-sided, and Dio felt that Sabbath should not open for any band, much less his 'rival' (and the band's former frontman) Ozzy Osbourne. Dio's contract expired at the end of the Dehumanizer tour and he chose not to do the two Osbourne Costa Mesa shows.\n\nFor these two shows the band replaced Dio with Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford and, on the second night, Iommi, Butler and original Sabbath drummer Bill Ward joined Osbourne onstage for four songs. Halford and Dio are friends (Dio having been impressed with Halford's work ethic on the 'Stars' project) and Halford would only do the Costa Mesa shows with Dio's blessing, which he received when he spoke with Dio by phone. Both shows were recorded in their entireties and are now widely circulated as audio and video bootlegs.\n\nIt is somewhat unclear as to whether this album was supposed to be a one-off affair or the beginning of a true reunion of this Sabbath line-up. Dio's contract technically ran out at the end of the album's tour (allowing him to quit the band in response to Tony Iommi's desire to have the band open for Ozzy Osbourne) which would suggest that future albums were not meant to be.

The album consists of some of the band's most readily identifiable work including "Iron Man", "War Pigs", and "Paranoid".\n\nThe album is regarded as a classic, and one of the most influential of the heavy metal genre. It has been certified quadruple platinum with over four million copies in the US alone, making it Black Sabbath's best-selling album.\n\nThe "Paranoid" single, released before the album, reached number four in the UK. Pushed by its success, the album hit number one in the UK, and is the only Black Sabbath album to have done so. The US release was held until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of Paranoid's UK release. The album broke into the top ten in the US in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the US alone, with virtually no radio airplay. The chart success of "Paranoid" in the US allowed the band to tour there for the first time in December 1970. This spawned the release of the album's second single "Iron Man", and although it failed to reach the top 40, "Iron Man" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs.\n\nThe album was again panned by music critics of the era. However, modern-day music critics are much more favourable towards the album than those of the time. An example is Allmusic's Steve Huey, who cites "Paranoid" as "one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time", which "defined the sound and style of metal, more than any other record in history".\n\n    * In 1999, Q Magazine (12/99, p.170) included it in their list of The Best Gothic Albums Of All Time, writing that, " stamped their bombastic and doom-laden imprint on British rock forever."\n    * In 1999, Vibe (12/99, p.162) included it on their list of 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n    * In 2003, the album was ranked number 130 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n    * In 2006, the album was ranked number 6 on Guitar World magazine's list of The Greatest 100 Guitar Albums of All Time.\n    * As of January 2009, the album is # 60 on Rate Your Music's Top Albums of All Time list and #2 on their Best Albums of 1970 ranking. \n\nAfter the release of their eponymous debut album in February 1970, Black Sabbath returned to the studio in June that year, again with producer Rodger Bain, to record their second album. The album was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England. The album's eponymous single "Paranoid" was written in the studio at the last minute. As drummer Bill Ward explains: "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the "Paranoid" guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom." The song was written with no intention of it being a successful hit for the band, only to be a filler on the album.\n\nThe album was originally titled "War Pigs", but allegedly the record company changed it to Paranoid, fearing backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. At the time, the band felt that the song was lighter, with the potential to become a single. However, the band's visual interpretation of a "war pig" was still featured on the cover; a distorted, eerie photograph of a man with sword and shield jumping out from behind a tree. This image confused many of the band's fans, who thought that the image did not resemble the album title to any extent.\n\nThe original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve. The inner of the gatefold had a black and white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill, and was their first appearance on album artwork. To spread the original picture over the gatefold, Ozzy Osbourne was separated from the other members of the band and a section of the grass was copied and dropped into the gap. This is only readily apparent if one compares it with the original photograph.\n\nIn comparison with their previous album, the songs on "Paranoid" were given more focus and direction, with less improvisation. However the lyrical content is equally as dark, exploring themes such as war, mental illness, drug abuse and sci-fi horror. Much of the album could be viewed as a kind of social commentary. Spin magazine wrote that the band "saw heavy rock as a way to emulate the horrors of a fallen world."\n\nThe lyrics of the opening song, "War Pigs", discuss war and the absurdities of those who make war without regard for those forced to fight it. It is often viewed as a protest song. Similarly, the lyrics of "Electric Funeral" discuss the bleak aftermath of nuclear warfare. These songs were written in the midst of the Vietnam War and the Cold War, and could be seen as quite representative of the political situation at the time.\n\nThe song "Paranoid" is uncharacteristically fast and simplistic for Black Sabbath in their early days. Supposedly the band members intended it only as an interlude or as "filler". Its lyrics concern the stigma of mental illness. In a related way, "Iron Man" is about a time traveller from the future who has been turned to steel. He is outcast by society but eventually takes his revenge on humanity. It is also a reference to Vietnam war veterans, who upon returning from war were outcast by society and had no help re-integrating into normal life or dealing with their post war mental disorders.\n\nThe song "Iron Man" is thematically very similar to the Ted Hughes novel, The Iron Man. This book was made into an animated film which was called The Iron Giant.\n\nThree songs on the album appear to concern dreams, hallucinations and drug use. "Planet Caravan" and "Fairies Wear Boots" are quite psychedelic in style and their lyrics are quite abstract. "Hand of Doom" was written as a message against heroin use. The song transitions between slow, soft passages and fast, loud passages as a representation of the drug being injected.	f

Initial writing and demo sessions at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham featured Cozy Powell and bootlegs exist.\n\nAlbum information\nBoth lyrically and musically, it is considered one of Sabbath's heaviest albums. Song themes vary from a computer worshipped as a god, to televangelists, to individualism and doubts about after-life.\n\nThe album was originally to be done with drummer Cozy Powell, but he was in a horse riding accident, which broke his pelvis. Dio wanted to get Simon Wright, from AC/DC and later his own band, as drummer, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. So, they called Vinny Appice to be drummer. During the sessions however, 2 unreleased songs were recorded: "The Night Life", whose riff was later used for Psychophobia on Cross Purposes; And "Bad Blood", which sounds very similar to "I" on the same album. These songs can be found, along with other demos and untitled songs on bootlegged "Complete Dehumanizer Sessions" along with the Geezer Butler Band's version of "Master of Insanity" and "Computer God", which sounds like an entirely different song.\n\n"Computer God" was the title of an unreleased song by The Geezer Butler Band, in 1986 - only the title made it to Dehumanizer. The GBB version is available as a download on Geezer Butler's website. "Master of Insanity" was also an unreleased GBB track and the Dehumanizer version is essentially a re-recording of this. (1:17 minutes of this track is available as a download on the website of Carl Sentance, erstwhile vocalist with The GBB.)\n\nAlthough the band lineup is the same as 1981's Mob Rules, the musical direction is very different - not only because of the aforementioned heaviness, but the songs are also darker, more pessimistic and more intense than in every earlier Sabbath album. It was a dramatic, and to some, welcome return from their previous album, Tyr.\n\nRonnie James Dio himself would follow this musical / lyrical direction in his next two albums with his band Dio, Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996).\n\nCommercially, this album is regarded as a resurgence for Sabbath. The album reached the Top 40 in the UK. It peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThis incarnation of Sabbath ended when Ronnie James Dio abruptly quit the band upon guitarist Tony Iommi's suggestion that the band open for Ozzy Osbourne in Costa Mesa at the end of his 1992 tour, intended to be the farewell tour. Dio and Osbourne had a history of animosity, more from Osbourne's side but certainly not one-sided, and Dio felt that Sabbath should not open for any band, much less his 'rival' (and the band's former frontman) Ozzy Osbourne. Dio's contract expired at the end of the Dehumanizer tour and he chose not to do the two Osbourne Costa Mesa shows.\n\nFor these two shows the band replaced Dio with Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford and, on the second night, Iommi, Butler and original Sabbath drummer Bill Ward joined Osbourne onstage for four songs. Halford and Dio are friends (Dio having been impressed with Halford's work ethic on the 'Stars' project) and Halford would only do the Costa Mesa shows with Dio's blessing, which he received when he spoke with Dio by phone. Both shows were recorded in their entireties and are now widely circulated as audio and video bootlegs.\n\nIt is somewhat unclear as to whether this album was supposed to be a one-off affair or the beginning of a true reunion of this Sabbath line-up. Dio's contract technically ran out at the end of the album's tour (allowing him to quit the band in response to Tony Iommi's desire to have the band open for Ozzy Osbourne) which would suggest that future albums were not meant to be. However, Iommi also formally fired the other three band members (including twice firing singer Tony Martin) which would indicate that he never really intended to bring them back. It has been suggested that the album was officially a one-off effort but that the band members would continue if they found they could co-exist well enough to do so. According to Ronnie James Dio, the band could not get along sufficiently as the members' personalities and egos had not changed over the previous decade. There were also rumors that talks of a reunion with Ozzy took place during the Dehumanizer tour; it being alleged that Iommi and Butler went so far as to discuss this with Osbourne, who ultimately backed out. It is possible these talks were used by the Osbourne camp to derail the Dehumanizer reunion.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi.\n\n\n Side one\n"Computer God" – 6:10 \n"After All (The Dead)" – 5:37 \n"TV Crimes" – 3:58 \n"Letters From Earth" – 4:12 \n"Master Of Insanity" – 5:54 \n\nSide two\n"Time Machine" – 4:10 \n"Sins Of The Father" – 4:43 \n"Too Late" – 6:54 \n"I" – 5:10 \n"Buried Alive" – 4:47 \n\nBonus track\nThe US-release added a bonus track:\n\n"Time Machine (Wayne's World Version)" – 4:18 This is the first recording of the song, specifically for the soundtrack to "Wayne's World" and ahead of the album sessions.

I want to remain true to self, but also true to my fans and just giving them a good project, a great project to be able to listen to, but also for different artists to be able to feed off of, create off of, come up with different ideas and just being at the forefront of just making a solid album, a solid, complete album. It's just very important to me."\n\nOn May 12, 2020, the album was retitled to High Off Life, as the previous title, Life Is Good, was considered to not play well during a global pandemic (COVID-19).

It was released on October 19, 2018 by Epic Records, Freebandz, Grade A and Interscope Records after being originally announced on October 17, 2018. The lead single "Fine China" was released on October 15, 2018. It features artists such as Young Scooter, Young Thug, Lil Wayne, Yung Bans, Gunna and Nicki Minaj.\n\nAfter the release of "Fine China", Wrld on Drugs was revealed as a joint project by both Future and Juice Wrld on their social media accounts. The project consists of sixteen songs. A handwritten track list featuring scribbling on a whiteboard was published by both the artists with the caption "Pluto x Juice #WRLDONDRUGS", which refers to Future as Pluto, a reference to Future's debut album Pluto. Future also revealed he and Juice Wrld have worked in the studio on the project, urging the latter to "make the cover artwork, pick the songs and put it out ASAP." He stated "Me & JuiceWorlddd in the studio rite now…we jus did enough heat to drop a tape this week." On the whiteboard, the phrases "whatever you addicted too" and "$$$ is a drug?" were written.\n\nThe Source has linked the album's title to the passing of rapper Mac Miller, stating "The title itself is interesting and speaks to the current state of Hip-Hop. With the recent drug-related passing of Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller, one can wonder whether the project will be open about drug usage or mental illness in the world's biggest genre." HotNewHipHop suggested the drug naming in the song titles suggest there could exist a high number of drug references in the mixtape.\n\nWrld on Drugs debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 behind A Star Is Born by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, with 98,000 album-equivalent units, which included 8,000 pure album sales. It serves as Future's tenth top-ten album in the United States, and Juice Wrld's second.

Then at the start of 2022, a series of events changed my life, my mental health, and ultimately the way I viewed music and art. Writing songs is my therapy. It helps me make sense of my feelings. I wrote without thought of what the songs would be, I just wrote whatever tumbled out. And in just over a week I replaced a decade’s worth of work with my deepest darkest thoughts. Within the space of a month, my pregnant wife got told she had a tumour, with no route to treatment until after the birth. My bestfriend, Jamal, a brother to me, died suddenly, and I found myself standing in court defending my integrity and career as a songwriter. I was spiralling through fear, depression and anxiety. I felt like I was drowning, head below the surface, looking up but not being able to break through for air. As an artist I didn’t feel like I could credibly put a body of work into the world that didn’t accurately represent where I am and how I need to express myself at this point in my life. This album is purely that. It’s opening the trapdoor into my soul. For the first time, I’m not trying to craft an album people will like, I’m merely putting something out that’s honest and true to where I am in my adult life. This is last February’s diary entry and my way of making sense of it. This is Subtract."\n—Ed Sheeran via Facebook	f

It features some of Metallica's most popular songs, "Enter Sandman", "The Unforgiven", "Nothing Else Matters" , "Wherever I May Roam" and "Sad but True". It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard 200. Metallica is the band's best-selling album to date, with over 16 million physical copies sold in the United States and over 31 million copies worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.\n\nThe album cover features only the band's logo, angled against the upper left corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the Gadsden flag, "Don't Tread on Me", is also the title of a song featured on the album.\n\nThe cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).\n\nMetallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.\n\nWhile the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad "Nothing Else Matters". Moreover, following the success of "One," the breakaway single from their …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. ("Enter Sandman", "Nothing Else Matters", "Sad but True", "Wherever I May Roam" and "The Unforgiven").\n\nThe lyrics of The Black Album, written by James Hetfield, were much more personal and introspective in nature than previous Metallica albums. For example, "The God That Failed" dealt with Hetfield's mother's death from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment. "Nothing Else Matters" expresses the connection Hetfield felt with a girlfriend while out on the road. The album ended Metallica's tradition of including a lengthy instrumental track on each album until their 2008 album Death Magnetic.\n\n    * Rolling Stone (9/5/91) - 5 Stars — Excellent — Included in Rolling Stone's "Essential Recordings of the 90's" - "Several songs...seem destined to become hard-rock classics.... effectively bridg the gap between commercial metal and the much harder thrash of Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth." In 2003, the album was ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n    * Spin (9/99, p.146) - Ranked #52 in Spin Magazine's "90 Greatest Albums of the '90s" - Spin (p.89) - "This record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads."\n\n    * Entertainment Weekly (8/16/91) - "Rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone...Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash." - Rating: B+\n\n    * Q magazine (8/00, p.127) - Included in Q's "Best Metal Albums of All Time" - "Transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars....bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power."\n\n    * Melody Maker (12/91) - Ranked #16 in Melody Maker's list of the top 30 albums of 1991 - "In a committed move away from their thrash roots, Metallica was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they'd done before."\n\n\nMetallica was produced by Bob Rock, who was originally asked to mix the album as the band was impressed with his work as producer on the Mötley Crüe album, Dr. Feelgood. Initially, the band was not interested in having Rock produce their album, but changed their minds as Ulrich stated; "We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob  could help us make it." The Black Album's sound was a marked difference from the stripped down production of the previous album. Rock altered the band's working schedule and routine so much that they swore never to work with him again. The animosity and tension between band and producer was documented in the documentaries A Year And A Half In The Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: The Black Album. Both explore and document the intense and merciless recording process that resulted in The Black Album.\n\nDespite the controversies between the band and Rock, he continued to work with the band up until, and including, the 2003 album St. Anger.\n\nThe world tour following the Metallica album, initially dubbed the "Wherever We May Roam Tour" and then later the "Nowhere Else To Roam Tour", saw Metallica on the road for the next three years. The tour was in part documented in the A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary, as well as the 3-CD, 2-DVD (or 3-VHS) boxset Live Shit: Binge & Purge.	f

It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 22, 2010, following a period of public controversy for West in the preceding year, for which he retreated to a "self-imposed exile" in Hawaii. There, he worked on the album in a communal recording environment that involved numerous contributing musicians and producers. Guest vocalists on the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.\n\nProduction was primarily handled by West, with additional production from a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.\n\nTo promote the album, West released free songs through his G.O.O.D. Fridays series, and four singles: the Billboard hits POWER, Monster, Runaway, and the international hit All Of The Lights. The album was also promoted with a short film directed by West called "Runaway" set to the album's music, functioning as a companion piece to the record. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA for having sold over 3,000,000 copies in the United States as of 2022. \n\nIn its first week of release, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 496,000 copies. The entry blocked Nicki Minaj's debut album Pink Friday from the top spot with 375,000 sales; the week marked the first time in two years that the chart had two albums bow with over 300,000 units. It also gave West his fourth consecutive US number-one album and surpassed the 450,000 first-week sales of 808s & Heartbreak, with the debut becoming the fourth-best sales week of 2010. The album's first-week digital sales of 224,000 units accounted for 45% of the total and stood as the fourth-highest digital copies for an album in a week.\n\nIn its second week on the Billboard 200, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy descended six places to number seven with 108,000 copies sold, marking a 78% sales decline while remaining above Pink Friday by one place. The album lasted for 115 weeks on the Billboard 200, and as of July 2013, it has sold 1,300,000 copies in the United States, as reported by Nielsen SoundScan. By June 2011, the album had sold 483,000 digital copies, ranking as the second best-selling digital rap album ever. On November 23, 2020, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for pushing 3,000,000 certified units in the US. According to Billboard, as of 2022, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the Hot 100.\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was a chart-topper in Canada, giving West his fourth number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart. It was less successful in Denmark, reaching number four on the Danish Albums chart. On March 9, 2021, the album was certified double platinum by IFPI Danmark for shipments of 40,000 in Denmark. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy opened at number six on the ARIA Albums chart and on September 10, 2021, it was awarded a double platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for over 140,000 copies shipped in Australia. The album charted within the top 10 in Norway, South Korea, New Zealand, and Switzerland. In 2018, it was reported that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy had been streamed a billion times on Spotify.\n\nWidely considered West's magnum opus, the album was an immediate and widespread critical success. It became the first new release to be rated a perfect 10 by Pitchfork since  Wilco's 2002 album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, became West's third studio album to top the Village Voice's annual year-end Pazz and Jop critics' poll, was named the best album in many publications' year-end and decade-end lists (including Rolling Stone, Billboard, Pitchfork, Stereogum, and The A.V. Club), and has since appeared on several lists ranking the Greatest Albums of All-Time, including on Rolling Stone Magazine's 2020 List of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time, and NME's 2013 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time.	f
1083	45	Graduation	2007-01-01	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/8c6578a2099561992fb7544e6826f767/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Graduation is the third studio album by American rapper Kanye West, released  September 11, 2007, by Def Jam and Roc-A-Fella.\n\nInspired by stadium tours, house music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. The album prematurely concludes the education theme of West's first two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005), as his aborted "Good Ass Job" album would have concluded the concept album's themes as a tetralogy instead of a trilogy as it ended up being.\n\nRecording sessions took place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers, including DJ Toomp. The album also features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, DJ Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow American rapper 50 Cent's Curtis (2007) generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\nGraduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 5 million copies in the United States and been certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits "Stronger", "Good Life" and "Homecoming", with the former of the three topping the US Billboard Hot 100. The album received widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album of the Year. It was named as one of the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists and later named to the lists of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and NME's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.	f

It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\nA widespread critical success, The College Dropout was praised for West's production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music's balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. It earned the rapper several accolades including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been named by Time, Rolling Stone, and other publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn the years leading up to the album, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded The College Dropout over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.\n\nThe album's production was primarily handled by West and developed his "chipmunk soul" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch-shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; it also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.\n\nThe College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a massive commercial success, becoming West's best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014. The album was promoted with singles such as "Through The Wire", "Jesus Walks", "All Falls Down", and "Slow Jamz", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.	f

It was released June 18, 2013, by Def Jam Recordings. The album follows his maximalist 2010 effort My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The album was primarily recorded in Paris, with West enlisting various artists and close collaborators for work and production on the album. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin a mere week shy of its release to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.\n\nMusically, "Yeezus" is darker and sonically experimental, combining elements of Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Promotion of "Yeezus" included worldwide video projections of the music and live television performances. The album received rave reviews from music critics upon its release.	f

Multiple sources, including Def Jam, announced a July 23, 2021 release date; the album remained unreleased on that date. Release dates between August 6 and August 15 were speculated, including being listed on the music services iTunes and Apple Music. These dates were later revised to August 20, and later changed again to August 27, with the latter date also announced by West's manager, Bu Thiam.

It was recorded after the death of his mother and subsequent dissolution of his engagement to a long-time girlfriend in 2008, and marked a major sonic departure for West. Taking influences from 80s new wave, synthpop, and art pop, West produced the album with heavy use from the Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. Lil' Wayne, Young Jeezy, Kid Cudi, and Mr. Hudson appear as featured artists on the album. Due to the lack of profanity, 808s & Heartbreak is West's first album without the Parental Advisory logo.\n\nCommercially, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album has (as of 2022) sold over 3,700,000 copies, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. Lead single Love Lockdown peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second single Heartless peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2009. \n\nReleased to a polarizing reaction from the public and critics alike, 808s & Heartbreak has since gone to become hailed as one of the greatest and most influential albums of the all time, with the album being attributed to the breakout popularity of more 'emotionally vulnerable' hip-hop artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake, and pioneering the 'emo rap' and 'alternative R&B' subgenres in particular. Rolling Stone magazine selected 808s among its '40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time' list in 2014, and eventually ranked the album at 244 on its 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.	f

Recording sessions for the album took place over the course of a year at Record Plant Studios, Chalice Recording Studios, and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood, and at Sony Music Studios in New York City. West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.\n\nThe production is notably more lush and elaborate than West's previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.\n\nThe album produced five singles, including the international hits "Touch the Sky", "Heard 'Em Say" and "Gold Digger", the last of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. The album has sold over 3.1 million units in the United States and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nUpon its release, Late Registration received rave reviews from music critics and earned West several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards and an Album of the Year nomination. It appeared at the top of several publications year-end lists of top albums. Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2005, and included it at number 118 on its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2012.	f

The album was recorded on September 21, 2005 in front of a live audience of 300 invited guests at Abbey Road Studios in London, England, with West backed by a seventeen-piece all-female string orchestra. The concert features selections from West's first and second albums, The College Dropout and Late Registration.\n\nThe album artwork features West's mascot the Dropout Bear crossing the Abbey Road crosswalk, paying homage to The Beatles' famed 1969 album Abbey Road. The album received critical acclaim for West's performance and for the string orchestra, and has since been cited by the BBC as an influential album for its fusion of live orchestras with hip-hop, influencing the likes of Nas, Kendrick Lamar, Migos and even Sir Mix-A-Lot to perform with strings in the decades following.	f

The project debuted on October 25, 2019, a little over a year after the initial release date for Yandhi, which was scrapped and reworked into a gospel album.\n\nTo the surprise of many, his wife Kim Kardashian took to Twitter on August 29, 2019, to announce Ye’s newest solo effort on his behalf—along with its title, tracklist, and release date. On the same day, producer Teddy Walton tweeted about his involvement with the project:\n\n"Been editing these @kanyewest vocals to make it sound like some graduation shit. The year ain’t done."\n\nThroughout 2019, Kanye began hosting “Sunday Service” worship events, where he performs gospel-inspired versions of his classic songs with a choir and special guests. On the morning of Easter 2019, he debuted the album’s seventh track, “Water,” at Coachella’s Sunday Service.\n\nOn September 27, 2019, fans speculated that Kanye would release the album after his Detroit Sunday Service. Instead, Detroit’s Fox Theatre announced a free show via Twitter, called ‘Jesus Is King: A Kanye West Experience,’ where Kanye played the album privately. An hour before the show’s start, Kim tweeted once again, sharing an updated tracklist. After the show, Kim uploaded an Instagram story announcing that the album would release on Sunday, September 29, following listening parties in Chicago and New York. This release date, however, went unmet and there were no subsequent announcements for almost a month.\n\nOn October 20, 2019, Kanye made a sudden reappearance on Twitter to announce that the new release date was set for October 25, 2019. He also revealed the cover art, featuring blue vinyl.\n\nFollowing its release, the album opened at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, as well as the Gospel, Christian and R&B/Hip-Hop albums charts. It was the first time that a Christian-centered, hip-hop album would top the main national chart since 2014, when Lecrae had managed to do the same with his album Anomaly.\n\nIt was also Kanye’s ninth consecutive debut at number one in his career, tying him with a record held by Eminem: a fair share that lasted until 2020, when the Detroit-based rapper took the lead again, following the chart-topping debut of Music to be Murdered By.	f

Featuring 20 tracks, the album features a wide array of guest vocalists; including Rihanna, Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, Kid Cudi, Chris Brown, André 3000 and more.\n\nDue to "The Life of Pablo" being available on Tidal only, estimations suggest that the album was pirated over 500,000 times only a few days after being made available for streaming. Some reports claimed that Kanye West had lost $10 million in album sales as a result. \n\nOn 31 March 2016 an article was published by The New York Times in which bore the following information: “Songs from 'The Life of Pablo' were streamed 400 million times, globally, through Monday, according to data provided to The New York Times by the company. Of those streams, Tidal said 250 million came in the first 10 days.  The industry standard counts 1,500 streams as equivalent to one album sold; 400 million streams for “Pablo” would equal about 267,000 albums, making it the best-selling hip-hop release of the year so far.”.	f

West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. The album prematurely concludes the education theme of West's first two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005), as his aborted "Good Ass Job" album would have concluded the concept album's themes as a tetralogy instead of a trilogy as it ended up being.\n\nRecording sessions took place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers, including DJ Toomp. The album also features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, DJ Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow American rapper 50 Cent's Curtis (2007) generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\nGraduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 5 million copies in the United States and been certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits "Stronger", "Good Life" and "Homecoming", with the former of the three topping the US Billboard Hot 100. The album received widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album of the Year. It was named as one of the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists and later named to the lists of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and NME's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.	f

It features an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993 for the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 14, 1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played mainly lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines, David Bowie, Meat Puppets (during which they were joined by members of the group onstage) and Leadbelly.\n\nMTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released in the wake of the April 1994 death of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the most successful posthumous Nirvana release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with.

Produced by Butch Vig, it was Nirvana's first release on the DGC label, as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl.\n\nNevermind is often credited with initiating a resurgence of punk culture among teenagers and young adults of Generation X. In addition, it was responsible in part for bringing both grunge and alternative rock music to a mainstream audience and ending the dominance of hair metal.	f

Following the success of the group's 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind, Nirvana sought to avoid that album's polished production and hired recording engineer Steve Albini to produce the record. The band recorded In Utero with Albini in two weeks in February 1993, capturing an abrasive and naturalistic sound for the record. While some of the songs had been written years prior, the lyrics largely dealt with frontman Kurt Cobain's reflections on his newfound fame and recent personal troubles, incorporating imagery of sickness and disease.\n\nSoon after recording was completed, controversy erupted as news reports stated that DGC did not like the band's sessions with Albini and refused to release the album, deeming it uncommercial. Nirvana denied the statements but were also not fully satisfied with the sound Albini captured. The band ultimately made some minor changes to the album's sound and hired producer Scott Litt to mix the singles "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies". Upon its release, "In Utero" debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from "Nevermind". The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over four million copies in the United States.\n\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting "In Utero"; the company's head of marketing told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of "Nevermind", and explained that the label would "set things up, duck, and get out of the way". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Utero's singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single "Heart-Shaped Box" to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that "In Utero" would not be as successful as "Nevermind". Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much."\n\n"In Utero" was released on September 13, 1993 in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 in the United States; it was initially only available in vinyl record and cassette tape formats, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was issued on compact disc in the UK on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. "In Utero" debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores Walmart and K-Mart refused to sell the album. According to The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album "didn't fit within our merchandise mix". In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album's back cover. DGC issued a new version of the album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, and listed the name of "Rape Me" as "Waif Me". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they "really want to make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".\n\n"In Utero" received acclaim from critics. Time's Christopher John Farley stated in his review of the album, "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote, "In Utero is a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne (who gave the album a rating of B+) commented "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." NME gave the album an eight out of ten rating. However, reviewer John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, "As a document of a mind in flux — dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity — Kurt should be proud of . As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." Critics ranked "In Utero" as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nThat October, Nirvana embarked on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured "All Apologies" and "Rape Me", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg of the tour in February 1994, but it was cancelled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation, but the singer went missing soon afterwards, and on April 8 he was found dead in his Seattle home as the result of suicide by a shotgun blast. The intended third single from "In Utero", "Pennyroyal Tea", was cancelled in the wake of Cobain's death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain's body was discovered, "In Utero" moved back up the Billboard charts, from number 72 to number 27.\n\nIn the ensuing years, "In Utero" has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 Guitar World article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album's release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that "In Utero" was "a far better record  and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then "In Utero" is that lost pearl." That same year, Pitchfork Media placed In Utero at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked it at number 439 on its list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2004 Blender ranked it at number 94 in its "100 Greatest American Albums of All Time" list, while in 2005, Spin placed it at number 51 on its "100 Greatest Albums 1985-2005" retrospective. "In Utero" has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over five million units, and has sold a total of four million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.	f

On tour, Styles debuted two unreleased songs, "Oh Anna" and "Medicine", which were originally written for the album.\n\n"A lot of my influences, and the stuff that I love, is older... I didn't want to put out my first album and be like, 'He's tried to re-create the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties.' Loads of amazing music was written then, but I'm not saying I wish I lived back then. I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 230,000 album-equivalent units, of which 193,000 were pure album sales. It is the highest first sales week for a British male artist's debut full-length album since Nielsen SoundScan began in 1991. Selling 67,000 units in its second week, it fell down to number three.\n\nThe album was ranked number 22 on the list of the top 40 biggest albums of 2017 on the UK Album Chart. It was the fourth best selling album by a British artist worldwide in 2017. According to IFPI, it was the ninth best selling album of 2017, with 1 million copies shipped globally. The album was Sony Music's biggest global seller in the second quarter of 2017. It was the sixth best selling album of 2017 in Mexico.\n\n"Sign of the Times" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the song debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single, "Two Ghosts", peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart and number 34 on the US Mainstream Top 40 charts.	f

The earliest live performance on this album dating back to 1989.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling nearly 159,000 copies in its first week of release. It spent 25 weeks on the chart and became the band's sixth platinum album since 1991.\n\nFrom the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah was the second Nirvana album to be released following the death of vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain in April 1994. It was compiled primarily by bassist Krist Novoselic, who also wrote the album's liner notes. Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl had originally intended on releasing a live album in 1994 to accompany what became MTV Unplugged in New York in a two-disc set originally titled Verse Chorus Verse, a reference to the most prevalent song structure in the band's music, which had also been a working title for the band's third album, In Utero, as well as the title of two Nirvana songs. However, Novoselic and Grohl reportedly had a difficult time working on the album so soon after Cobain's death, and the album was compiled, but never mixed. The original track list featured several songs not present on From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah—"Serve the Servants", "Dive", "Rape Me", "Sappy" and "Territorial Pissings"—and different versions of the overlapping songs, other than "Negative Creep" and "Scentless Apprentice".\n\nThe album's title refers to the Wishkah River in Aberdeen, Washington, where Cobain claimed to have spent nights sleeping under the Young Street Bridge as a teenager (as referenced in the song "Something in the Way", from the band's 1991 release Nevermind). This claim has since been refuted by Novoselic, who said, "He never lived under that bridge. He hung out there, but you couldn't live on those muddy banks, with the tide coming up and down. That was his own revisionism."	f

The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair in the midst of a thunderstorm. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical maturity and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine.\n\nRide the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at a few major music festivals, such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year contract and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.	f

Elektra Records released the album on August 25, 1988. This is the first Metallica studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, since it is the first after the tragic death of the group's former bassist Cliff Burton.\n\nThe album's dark subject material, featuring references to nuclear apocalypse, injustice in the law system, limited freedom, war, insanity and hate, is accompanied by the most complex song structures to this date in Metallica's discography. The album is also noted for its near lack of bass guitar and dry production and therefore has been called a "slightly flawed masterpiece and the pinnacle of Metallica's progressive years" by allmusic.com's reviewer.\n\nThe front cover depicts the statue of Lady Justice cracked and bound by ropes, with both of her scales filled with dollars and both of her breasts exposed. The words "…And Justice for All" are written in graffiti to the right. The cover is made by Stephen Gorman after a concept by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.\n\nThe album has sold over 8 million copies in the US alone according to the RIAA and was the best selling Metallica record upon its release. Metallica released four singles from …And Justice for All, "Eye of the Beholder", "Harvester of Sorrow", "…And Justice for All" and "One".\n\nProduction \n\nThe production of the album is noted for its unusual, and at times "one-dimensional", post-production mix. The quality of the album's sound has been described as "cold", "thin" and "flat", due in part to the way the instruments were recorded. The bass drums don't "thud" so much as "click", while the guitars "buzz thinly". And, in one of the more famous of Hetfield and Ulrich's controversies with bassist Jason Newsted, the album's production almost completely lacks identifiable bass in most songs. This has been attributed to various reasons, such as Newsted's doubling of Hetfield's guitar parts, his absence from the mixing sessions (where he might have asserted his opinion) and the lingering issue of his "newness" within the band following the tragic death of Cliff Burton in September 1986. As said by the band in their magazine SO WHAT!, they wish that they could re-mix the entire album because the drums and guitar overpower the bass completely. The album was released on two LPs at the usual single-LP price, since the band thought that putting the album on a single record would have diminished its fidelity.\n\nLyrical themes\n\nThe lyrics on …And Justice for All discuss politics and social issues; however, lyricist James Hetfield is more direct than ever before in his views. At the same time, and despite Hetfield's aggressive singing style, the lyrics refrain from overt confrontation or ringing calls for revolutionary change. Instead, as drummer Lars Ulrich explained it, the ideas expressed in the lyrics merely represented "interests" of the band, and were meant largely to be "documentary" in nature. Important themes in the songs include destruction of Earth in "Blackened", injustice in the law system in "…And Justice for All", limited freedom in "Eye of the Beholder", war and locked-in syndrome in "One", cheating and lying in "The Shortest Straw", infanticide in "Harvester of Sorrow", insanity in "The Frayed Ends of Sanity", the death of Cliff Burton in "To Live Is to Die" and hatred of authority in "Dyers Eve".\n\nConnections with other Metallica albums\n\nThe album continues the trends set by the previous albums Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets by having a fast paced, striking song with a melodic, slow intro as the first track, the title track as the second track, a slower, heavier track as the third track, a heavy metal ballad as the fourth track, a fast-paced track as the fifth track, a track slower than the fifth track as the sixth track, and an instrumental or mostly instrumental track as well as a fast, heavy song as the final tracks. However, in the case of this album, a song is added onto the structure ("The Frayed Ends of Sanity").\n\n\nIt has been noted by several people that the complexity of the songs on …And Justice for All was a direct reason for the more simple structures on Metallica's next album, The Black Album. Allmusic.com's reviewer Steve Huey also pointed out that …And Justice for All's unusual production may have led Metallica to a more "professional" producer, Bob Rock. It can be said that …And Justice for All marked the end of Metallica's thrash metal period, at least until their newest album, Death Magnetic.\n\nCritical response\n\n...And Justice for All was Metallica's breakthrough album and reached #6 in the Billboard charts. Though it would soon be over-shadowed commercially by the band's following album (1991's Metallica), this album nevertheless confirmed Metallica's large-scale arena status.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 1989, but with much controversy, it lost to Jethro Tull's Crest of a Knave. In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nIn 1990, "One" received the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, as well as being Metallica's first Grammy Award.\n\nThe guitar solo of "One" was ranked #7 in Guitar World's compilation of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time.\n\nThe album was ranked at number nine in IGN's Top 25 Metal Albums.\n\nMetallica released their first music video for "One", after years of resisting pressure to release videos for their tracks. The video incited controversy among their fans, who had valued the band's apparent opposition to MTV and other forms of mainstream commercial metal. "One" entered the Top 40 on March 25, 1989 at #35.\n\nLive performances\n\nHammett noted the length of the songs being problematic for fans and the band. "Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long," he said. "One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again.'"\n\nIn spite of this, the song "One" quickly gained a permanent fixture in the band's live playlist since the release of the album. The only other song from …And Justice For All that has come close to this is "Harvester of Sorrow," a song that was played live heavily after the album's release but has only begun to be played again recently.\n\n16 years after "Dyers Eve" was recorded, on March 5, 2004, the band performed the song in its entirety for the first time ever on the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, at the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Metallica played the title track for the first time since October 1989, in Lisbon on the first show of their Sick of the Studio '07 tour and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that routing. In 2008, "...And Justice for All" was played again during their 2008 Tour.\n\nTo date, "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" and "To Live Is to Die" remain the only songs from the album that have never been performed live in their entirety. Instead, the band played segments of them during solos or impromptu jams.\n\nAlong with "Dyers Eve", "To Live Is to Die" is one of the most demanded songs to be played live of Metallica's catalogue, it is unknown if Metallica will play this song live, due to the song being made up of deceased bassist Cliff Burton's final riff tapes.	f

I think the most interesting part of this is the continued study of those core beliefs and how it affects our perception of the world today. Much of our adult experience is reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry."	f

S&M; contains performances of Metallica songs with additional symphonic accompaniment, which was composed by Michael Kamen, who also conducted the orchestra during the concert. The idea to combine heavy metal with an epic classical approach, as James Hetfield has stated repeatedly, was an idea of Cliff Burton. Burton’s love of classical music, especially of Johann Sebastian Bach, can be traced back to many instrumental parts and melodic characteristics in Metallica’s songwriting including songs from Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets. The other inspiration was Deep Purple's 1969 Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Purple revived their hybrid musical performance in 1999's Live at the Royal Albert Hall after being notified that Metallica were doing theirs earlier that year.\n\nIn addition to songs from previous albums spanning Ride the Lightning through ReLoad, there are two new compositions: "No Leaf Clover" and "−Human". "The Ecstasy of Gold" by Ennio Morricone, Metallica's entrance music, was played live by the orchestra. "No Leaf Clover" has since been performed by Metallica in concert, using a recording of the orchestral prelude. "−Human", credited as "Minus Human", was included in the soundtrack of the Electronic Arts game NHL 99, but has never subsequently been performed.\n\nSeveral other songs, including "Wasting My Hate", "The Unforgiven", "Low Man's Lyric", "Fade to Black", The Unforgiven II, "Through The Never", "Harvester of Sorrow", and unexpectedly "...And Justice For All" was a thought for the setlist but due to the gap since they last played it and with little time to prepare it was chopped, also "Ronnie" and even "Mama Said" were considered for selection, but were eventually dropped as it was decided by both Metallica and Kamen that they were not well suited for symphonic accompaniment. On the S&M DVD documentary, Metallica and Kamen can be seen and heard discussing the orchestration for the Anti-Nowhere League and Metallica favourite cover-song "So What?", though it's obvious both parties were enjoying a good joke and had no intentions of performing the song.\n\nChanges were made to the lyrics of some songs, most notably the removal of the second verse and chorus of "The Thing That Should Not Be" and playing the third verse in its place.	f

The record has been described by various music publications as a collection of soft rock, rock, Britpop and pop. It was preceded by the release of its lead single, "Sign of the Times", while "Two Ghosts" and "Kiwi" served as the second and third worldwide singles, respectively. In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first headlining concert tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from music critics and debuted atop the charts in several countries, including Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. It has been certified platinum in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, and Mexico. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Harry Styles was the ninth global best-selling album of 2017 with sales of one million copies.\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place in a number of locations, including in Los Angeles, London, and the Gee Jam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his production team had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn of 2016. The album was primarily recorded at The Village in Los Angeles.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, Styles announced the album's lead single to be "Sign of the Times", which was released on 7 April. The album name, artwork, and track list were revealed on 13 April. The album track "Sweet Creature" was released as a promotional single on 2 May. Styles performed the songs "Sign of the Times" and "Ever Since New York" on the 15 April episode of Saturday Night Live. On 21 April, Styles appeared on The Graham Norton Show for his first televised solo performance in his native country, and guested on the French talk show, Quotidien, five days later; he performed "Sign of the Times" on both shows.\n\nOn 9 May, Styles performed the tracks "Carolina", "Sign of the Times", "Ever Since New York", and a cover of One Direction's "Stockholm Syndrome" on The Today Show. On 13 May, a day after the album's release, he held a surprise concert at The Garage in London. Styles held a similar show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on 19 May, and invited Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks to perform as a special guest. Proceeds from both shows were donated to charity. On 15 May, Harry Styles: Behind the Album was released exclusively on Apple Music, a 49-minute documentary film showing footage from his writing and recording sessions in Jamaica and Los Angeles; The Performances version features a full-length live performance of the album filmed at London's Abbey Road Studios. Styles was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with James Corden every night in the week spanning from 15 to 18 May, and performed in various sketches alongside Corden. In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first solo tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, which ran from September 2017 through to July 2018 and visited North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America. On tour, Styles debuted two unreleased songs, "Oh Anna" and "Medicine", which were originally written for the album.\n\n"A lot of my influences, and the stuff that I love, is older... I didn't want to put out my first album and be like, 'He's tried to re-create the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties.' Loads of amazing music was written then, but I'm not saying I wish I lived back then. I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 230,000 album-equivalent units, of which 193,000 were pure album sales. It is the highest first sales week for a British male artist's debut full-length album since Nielsen SoundScan began in 1991. Selling 67,000 units in its second week, it fell down to number three.\n\nThe album was ranked number 22 on the list of the top 40 biggest albums of 2017 on the UK Album Chart. It was the fourth best selling album by a British artist worldwide in 2017. According to IFPI, it was the ninth best selling album of 2017, with 1 million copies shipped globally. The album was Sony Music's biggest global seller in the second quarter of 2017. It was the sixth best selling album of 2017 in Mexico.\n\n"Sign of the Times" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the song debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single, "Two Ghosts", peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart and number 34 on the US Mainstream Top 40 charts.	f

To date, the album has sold over 5 million copies in America, and is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 100,000 copies. It spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard 200.\n\nAt 78:59 minutes, Load is Metallica's longest studio album. Initial pressings of the album were affixed with stickers that boasted its long playtime, simply reading "78:59". Consequently, "The Outlaw Torn" had to be shortened by about one minute to fit on the album. The full version was released on a single for "The Memory Remains" as "The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)" with a running time of 10:48. \n\nAccording to drummer Lars Ulrich: "This album and what we're doing with it - that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die."\n\nThe songwriting dispenses almost entirely with the thrash metal style that characterized the band's sound in the 1980s. In place of staccato riffs, Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett experimented with more blues-based tones and styles. Additionally, Ulrich adopted a minimalist approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass patterns of previous albums.\n\nMost of this blues-based metal comes from of Ulrich's Deep Purple influences; one can hear Ian Paice's style in the regular cymbal attacks and drum hits, as well as Ritchie Blackmore's blues licks from the Mark III era of Deep Purple.	f

It spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard 200.\n\nAt 78:59 minutes, Load is Metallica's longest studio album. Initial pressings of the album were affixed with stickers that boasted its long playtime, simply reading "78:59". Consequently, "The Outlaw Torn" had to be shortened by about one minute to fit on the album. The full version was released on a single for "The Memory Remains" as "The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)" with a running time of 10:48. \n\nAccording to drummer Lars Ulrich: "This album and what we're doing with it - that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die."\n\nThe songwriting dispenses almost entirely with the thrash metal style that characterized the band's sound in the 1980s. In place of staccato riffs, Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett experimented with more blues-based tones and styles. Additionally, Ulrich adopted a minimalist approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass patterns of previous albums.\n\nMost of this blues-based metal comes from of Ulrich's Deep Purple influences; one can hear Ian Paice's style in the regular cymbal attacks and drum hits, as well as Ritchie Blackmore's blues licks from the Mark III era of Deep Purple.	f

Released on June 5, 2003, this album marks the longest time span between studio albums from Metallica, with the nearly six years between the release of “ReLoad” and “St. Anger.” \n\nIt was also the first to receive a Parental Advisory label excluding Garage Inc. (a cover album), Live S**t: Binge and Purge (a live album), and S&M (also a live album).\n\nThe album was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was instead released five days earlier due to fear of unlicensed copying over filesharing networks.\n\nSt. Anger received a mixed response from critics and fans alike. Many fans felt as if the old Metallica was replaced with a different band/sound. Though not all criticism was negative, some felt it was an experiment Metallica was going through and that Metallica was as strong as ever. \n\nOne reviewer, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters, took both sides to it, saying, “While it’s an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion for the first time in years.”	f

It was the first Metallica studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986.\n\n…And Justice for All was recorded in early 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. It features long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is infamous for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship. The cover, designed by Stephen Gorman based on a concept by Metallica guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, depicts Lady Justice bound in ropes. The album title is derived from the American Pledge of Allegiance. Three songs from the album were released as singles: "Harvester of Sorrow", "Eye of the Beholder" and "One"; the title track was released as a promotional single.\n\n…And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics. It was included in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll of the year's best albums, and the single "One", which also marked the band's first music video, earned Metallica its first Grammy Award (and the first ever in the Best Metal Performance category) in 1990. The group's best-selling album at the time, it was the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the United States, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200. The album was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping eight million copies in the U.S., making it Metallica's second-best-selling album in the country. A remastering of the album was released on November 2, 2018.	f

I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016.

After a very quiet 2021, in which he only released the single “SUVs (Black on Black)”, in collaboration with Pooh Shiesty, and was featured on Lil Nas X’s smash hit, “INDUSTRY BABY”, on February 4, 2022, Harlow made an Instagram post announcing that he was in the process of creating a new album, with the caption: Next chapter starts now. Two weeks later, he announced his official return with the lead single from the album, “Nail Tech”, released on February 18, 2022. The single was praised by several celebrities, including Kanye West, who called Harlow “one of the top 5 rappers right now” in a now-removed Instagram post. During an interview with Apple Music on February 18, the same day “Nail Tech” was released, Jack provided more details about the creative process of CHTKMY: I think everybody will understand once I give them this new work. I feel like I haven’t had a chance to lay on the world just how passionate and how studious I am, and just how capable I am.  And I think when I finish this album, it’ll be time for some of that. I think it’ll be refreshing for me to get into some of that. But right now, I’m in total work mode, man. On March 16, during a Rolling Stone interview, Harlow officially announced the release date and the title of his second album, stating that its production process was heavily inspired by Kanye West. On March 31, Harlow played a short snippet of the album’s second single “First Class” in his IGTV, with the caption: Locked in the studio finishing up this album for you. How ‘bout this one next? The following day, Harlow went to Instagram and officially announced the release date of the song, which features a particular sample of Fergie’s January 2007 hit “Glamorous”. He revealed the album’s cover art on Twitter on April 6, 2022, and released “First Class” two days later. On May 3, 2022, the rapper announced the project’s full tracklist on Instagram, with features from Pharrell Williams, Drake, Justin Timberlake and Lil Wayne.	f

It was also included on his debut studio album, Thats What They All Say, along with its remix. It was produced by JetsonMade, Pooh Beatz, and LosTheProducer. The song has been credited with projecting Harlow's name in the music industry, leading to later successes such as his first studio album, of which "Whats Poppin" features. The track reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100, in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It received a nomination for Best Rap Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. This collaboration of the producers, Pooh Beatz and JetsonMade, was their second, after working on DaBaby's ‘Suge’, with them both stating how they were already interested in each other's work prior to the creation of ‘Whats Poppin’. PoohBeatz stated that his brother was the reason for his discovery of Harlow, who told him that he was just the type of artist that he would enjoy working with. After discovering Harlow through his brother, JetsonMade was adamant that he was the type of artist he was looking for in a collaboration. The two toyed with different sounds until they were certain they had produced a perfect beat for the song, which ended up becoming one of 2020s biggest hits. PoohBeatz claimed that the songs title came after a conversation with Harlow about how he wants him to rap for the song, as he had been “popping shit”, causing Harlow to think about the title “What’s Poppin”. The beat for the song was one of the first that the producers came up with, after tweaking with the original and chopping parts out, they found the final version which was a simplistic beat, following from the two's success with 'Suge'. They said that the simpler the beat, the better, as it allows for the artists creativity to flourish. The use of the ‘808’ pattern was critical in ensuring that the song had enough ‘bounce’ to be a hit. After this, Harlow stated that he really enjoyed working with the ‘808’ pattern and attempted to incorporate it into his later music. However, JetsonMade made a slight altercation to the ‘808’ pattern, which he thought was crucial in making the song sound better aesthetically. Harlow later stated that when he heard the beat that “this one of the only beats I’ve ever just like heard, and was like I need this right now”. PoohBeatz has also said that he has thoroughly enjoyed the aftermath of the drop of ‘Whats Poppin’ where it has been featured in commercials, as well as the community making remixes. Additionally, Cole Bennett, a music video producer, sent Harlow a message suggesting some alterations to the song to make it more catchy, which Harlow ending up agreeing upon. The music video for the track, directed by Cole Bennett, was released the same day as the song on Cole's Lyrical Lemonade channel. It features a cameo of Ryan "Rhino" Burton of the YouTube comedy channel LoveLiveServe. As with many popular songs, the music video plays an integral part in its commercial success, resulting in exposure to a wider audience. The music video for ‘Whats Poppin?’ was created by popular music video producer ‘Lyrical Lemonade’, who has been involved in the production of several other popular music videos, such as productions with ‘Juice WRLD’ and ‘Eminem’. As of April, 2021, the music video has amassed over 130 million views on YouTube. For Harlow, having this song featured on this channel contributed to the success of the song globally. Furthermore, a breakdown video on the creation of ‘Whats Poppin?’ with producers Jetsonmade and PoohBeatz allowed for fans to gain a deeper insight into the song itself. Both producers have spoken about looking for a ‘fresh’ artist to make a new production with, after both collaborating with DaBaby on popular single ‘Suge’. Additionally, Cole Bennett did an interview in which he dissected the music video itself. Bennett said that an earlier video of Harlow’ for the song ‘Sundown’ was “refreshing”, causing him to message him on Twitter for a potential collaboration on his ‘Lyrical Lemonade’ channel in the future. Bennett initially rejected one of his songs, ‘Cody Banks’, as it wasn't the style he was looking for. He said he would only work with him if he found “absolutely perfect” song to allow the audience to get a sense of Harlow's charisma and character. The two became good friends, even throwing a New Year's Eve party together in 2019, until finally discovering ‘Whats Poppin’ in a set of songs that he Harlow sent Bennett, who instantly knew that it was perfect for his channel. Bennett was adamant on having the video in one general location, keeping the video, as well as the shooting process and budget, as simplistic as possible. Furthermore, Bennett suggested that the diner, featured in the music video, be the main location, where different areas of the diner are used in different creative lights, bringing in a unique “world” and making the video fun, such as turning the diner booth into a nightclub and a bed. Bennett said that the song itself involved a lot of wordplay, and that the best way to capture this was in various visual settings. Bennett made various creative decisions when making the video, for example the picture used in the video on the dartboard was taken on the set inside the diner by Bennett himself to get the same outfit and “feel” of where the video already was. Additionally, Bennett says the zooms throughout the video were unplanned, but he instead called in the middle of filming and rented out a zoom lens just for those particular shots, something he later admitted was a “vital role” in the video. At the end of this interview, Bennett stated that him and Harlow have a “bunch of stuff coming” following this collaboration. Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop called the track "one of Harlow's best in a minute". 'Whats Poppin' featured in many top 100 lists by the end of 2020, including finishing 5th in the Rolling Stone top 100 most popular songs of 2020. The song also featured in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100, finishing as the 42nd song on the list. Alongside these, the song was also recognised at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, receiving a nomination for 'Best Rap Performance', where it was beaten by 'Savage', a song by Megan Thee Stallion. The remix also received a nomination at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards for ‘Top Rap Song’, losing to DaBaby's ‘ROCKSTAR’, who also featured in ‘What’s Poppin’. The song also received a nomination for 'Top Streaming Song' and 'Top Collaboration (Fan Voted)'. Additionally, ‘TheEasternEcho’ had high praise for the remix of the song, saying that Harlow's personality has allowed him to attract bigger names for personality, saying that “he’s wack and people love it”. The addition of Tory Lanez, DaBaby and Lil Wayne on the song, whom have all achieved great heights in the industry allowed the song's exposure to grow greatly as a result. ‘The Musical Hype’ gave the song 3.5 stars out of a possible 5, saying that the song displayed Harlow's confidence but lacked any cutting-edge lyrics, instead offering up cliché lyrics about sex and money. Pitchfork stated that 'Whats Poppin' became such a huge success because of Harlow's likeable nature and charm, saying "he seems like the kinda guy you would find around a college campus, maybe at the basketball court". However, the song, as well as the music video, was criticised for using a "candy-coated aesthetic" to attract largely young fans, also being deemed "generic". Likewise, the song has also been criticised for its lyrics not taking much to process and not having many deep or meaningful lyrics. Pitchfork further established that Jack Harlow was more like a 'feel good' character as opposed to a clever artist, saying that the song's success is simply attributed to his ability to be in touch with the present society. The success of the original track resulted in Jack Harlow approaching DaBaby, Tory Lanez and Lil Wayne for a remix, which was released later on June 24, 2020, which also saw large commercial success. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the general public evidently received both the original track and the remix very well, with over 750,000,000 streams cumulatively for both songs on Spotify. "Whats Poppin" appears on the NBA 2K21 video game soundtrack. As well as appearing in one of the mix tapes in the game Call of Duty Modern Warfare (2019) and Call of Duty: Warzone, and in one of the Xbox Game Pass & EA Play trailers. Considering the song was one of 2020's biggest hits, combined with the resurgence of social media as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it inspired several internet trends and memes. At this stage, the song, including its remix, have been used in over 400,000 different videos on the social media platform TikTok. Additionally, the hashtag, ‘#whatspoppin”, has over 7 billion views on the platform The song inspired the ‘Glo-Up’ trend, where an individual would show a ‘before and after’ video of themselves using the song in the background, whilst lip syncing to the lyrics “What’s Poppin?”, as if to say ‘What’s up?’. Additionally, the beat of the song inspired others to add their own lyrics to the song for comedic purposes, most prominently was the trend of comical skits involving the lyrics “What’s Poppin? Don’t mind me just watching!”, created by Biddl3, which also went viral on TikTok, with over 350,000 videos. The song has also been accredited to projecting Jack Harlow's career and making him a well-known face in the industry and around the world. He has done several interview videos with respected YouTube channels such as GQ and Genius. As of April 2021, Harlow has amassed 2.2 million followers on Instagram.	f

Both producers have spoken about looking for a ‘fresh’ artist to make a new production with, after both collaborating with DaBaby on popular single ‘Suge’. Additionally, Cole Bennett did an interview in which he dissected the music video itself. Bennett said that an earlier video of Harlow’ for the song ‘Sundown’ was “refreshing”, causing him to message him on Twitter for a potential collaboration on his ‘Lyrical Lemonade’ channel in the future. Bennett initially rejected one of his songs, ‘Cody Banks’, as it wasn't the style he was looking for. He said he would only work with him if he found “absolutely perfect” song to allow the audience to get a sense of Harlow's charisma and character. The two became good friends, even throwing a New Year's Eve party together in 2019, until finally discovering ‘Whats Poppin’ in a set of songs that he Harlow sent Bennett, who instantly knew that it was perfect for his channel. Bennett was adamant on having the video in one general location, keeping the video, as well as the shooting process and budget, as simplistic as possible. Furthermore, Bennett suggested that the diner, featured in the music video, be the main location, where different areas of the diner are used in different creative lights, bringing in a unique “world” and making the video fun, such as turning the diner booth into a nightclub and a bed. Bennett said that the song itself involved a lot of wordplay, and that the best way to capture this was in various visual settings. Bennett made various creative decisions when making the video, for example the picture used in the video on the dartboard was taken on the set inside the diner by Bennett himself to get the same outfit and “feel” of where the video already was. Additionally, Bennett says the zooms throughout the video were unplanned, but he instead called in the middle of filming and rented out a zoom lens just for those particular shots, something he later admitted was a “vital role” in the video. At the end of this interview, Bennett stated that him and Harlow have a “bunch of stuff coming” following this collaboration. Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop called the track "one of Harlow's best in a minute". 'Whats Poppin' featured in many top 100 lists by the end of 2020, including finishing 5th in the Rolling Stone top 100 most popular songs of 2020. The song also featured in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100, finishing as the 42nd song on the list. Alongside these, the song was also recognised at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, receiving a nomination for 'Best Rap Performance', where it was beaten by 'Savage', a song by Megan Thee Stallion. The remix also received a nomination at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards for ‘Top Rap Song’, losing to DaBaby's ‘ROCKSTAR’, who also featured in ‘What’s Poppin’. The song also received a nomination for 'Top Streaming Song' and 'Top Collaboration (Fan Voted)'. Additionally, ‘TheEasternEcho’ had high praise for the remix of the song, saying that Harlow's personality has allowed him to attract bigger names for personality, saying that “he’s wack and people love it”. The addition of Tory Lanez, DaBaby and Lil Wayne on the song, whom have all achieved great heights in the industry allowed the song's exposure to grow greatly as a result. ‘The Musical Hype’ gave the song 3.5 stars out of a possible 5, saying that the song displayed Harlow's confidence but lacked any cutting-edge lyrics, instead offering up cliché lyrics about sex and money. Pitchfork stated that 'Whats Poppin' became such a huge success because of Harlow's likeable nature and charm, saying "he seems like the kinda guy you would find around a college campus, maybe at the basketball court". However, the song, as well as the music video, was criticised for using a "candy-coated aesthetic" to attract largely young fans, also being deemed "generic". Likewise, the song has also been criticised for its lyrics not taking much to process and not having many deep or meaningful lyrics. Pitchfork further established that Jack Harlow was more like a 'feel good' character as opposed to a clever artist, saying that the song's success is simply attributed to his ability to be in touch with the present society. The success of the original track resulted in Jack Harlow approaching DaBaby, Tory Lanez and Lil Wayne for a remix, which was released later on June 24, 2020, which also saw large commercial success. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the general public evidently received both the original track and the remix very well, with over 750,000,000 streams cumulatively for both songs on Spotify. "Whats Poppin" appears on the NBA 2K21 video game soundtrack. As well as appearing in one of the mix tapes in the game Call of Duty Modern Warfare (2019) and Call of Duty: Warzone, and in one of the Xbox Game Pass & EA Play trailers. Considering the song was one of 2020's biggest hits, combined with the resurgence of social media as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it inspired several internet trends and memes. At this stage, the song, including its remix, have been used in over 400,000 different videos on the social media platform TikTok. Additionally, the hashtag, ‘#whatspoppin”, has over 7 billion views on the platform The song inspired the ‘Glo-Up’ trend, where an individual would show a ‘before and after’ video of themselves using the song in the background, whilst lip syncing to the lyrics “What’s Poppin?”, as if to say ‘What’s up?’. Additionally, the beat of the song inspired others to add their own lyrics to the song for comedic purposes, most prominently was the trend of comical skits involving the lyrics “What’s Poppin? Don’t mind me just watching!”, created by Biddl3, which also went viral on TikTok, with over 350,000 videos. The song has also been accredited to projecting Jack Harlow's career and making him a well-known face in the industry and around the world. He has done several interview videos with respected YouTube channels such as GQ and Genius. As of April 2021, Harlow has amassed 2.2 million followers on Instagram.	f

Two weeks later, he announced his official return with the lead single from the album, “Nail Tech”, released on February 18, 2022. The single was praised by several celebrities, including Kanye West, who called Harlow “one of the top 5 rappers right now” in a now-removed Instagram post. During an interview with Apple Music on February 18, the same day “Nail Tech” was released, Jack provided more details about the creative process of CHTKMY: I think everybody will understand once I give them this new work. I feel like I haven’t had a chance to lay on the world just how passionate and how studious I am, and just how capable I am.  And I think when I finish this album, it’ll be time for some of that. I think it’ll be refreshing for me to get into some of that. But right now, I’m in total work mode, man. On March 16, during a Rolling Stone interview, Harlow officially announced the release date and the title of his second album, stating that its production process was heavily inspired by Kanye West. On March 31, Harlow played a short snippet of the album’s second single “First Class” in his IGTV, with the caption: Locked in the studio finishing up this album for you. How ‘bout this one next?

On May 3, 2022, the rapper announced the project’s full tracklist on Instagram, with features from Pharrell Williams, Drake, Justin Timberlake and Lil Wayne.	f

It is the sixth studio album by American recording artist Michael Jackson. The album was released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off The Wall, including funk, disco, soul, soft rock, jazz and pop. However, Thriller's lyrics deal with generally darker themes, including paranoia and the supernatural.\n\nWith a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of Thriller's nine tracks. Following the release of the album's first single "The Girl Is Mine", some observers assumed Thriller would only be a minor hit record. With the release of the second single "Billie Jean", the album topped the charts in many countries. It reached number one in the United States and the United Kingdom simultaneously, becoming the first album to do so. At its peak, the album was selling a million copies a week worldwide. In just over a year, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. Sales are estimated to be over 110 million copies sold worldwide as of March 2010. Seven of the album's nine songs were released as singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Despite numerous five-star reviews, Thriller was not universally praised.\n\nThriller cemented Jackson as one of the predominant pop stars of the late 20th century, and enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools—the videos for Thriller, "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song "Someone In the Dark", which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD.\n\nThriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time.

The record has been described by various music publications as a collection of soft rock, rock, Britpop and pop. It was preceded by the release of its lead single, "Sign of the Times", while "Two Ghosts" and "Kiwi" served as the second and third worldwide singles, respectively.

It has been certified platinum in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, and Mexico. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Harry Styles was the ninth global best-selling album of 2017 with sales of one million copies.\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place in a number of locations, including in Los Angeles, London, and the Gee Jam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his production team had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn of 2016. The album was primarily recorded at The Village in Los Angeles.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, Styles announced the album's lead single to be "Sign of the Times", which was released on 7 April.

In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first solo tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, which ran from September 2017 through to July 2018 and visited North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America. On tour, Styles debuted two unreleased songs, "Oh Anna" and "Medicine", which were originally written for the album.\n\n"A lot of my influences, and the stuff that I love, is older... I didn't want to put out my first album and be like, 'He's tried to re-create the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties.' Loads of amazing music was written then, but I'm not saying I wish I lived back then. I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 230,000 album-equivalent units, of which 193,000 were pure album sales. It is the highest first sales week for a British male artist's debut full-length album since Nielsen SoundScan began in 1991.

While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson wrote several of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death in 2009.\n\nThe record was a departure from Jackson's previous work for Motown. Several critics observed that "Off the Wall" was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained positive reviews and won the singer his first Grammy Award since the early 1970s. With "Off the Wall", Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The album was a commercial success; to date it is certified for 8× Multi-Platinum in the US and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.\n\nOn October 16, 2001, a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records. Recent reviews by Allmusic and Blender have continued to praise Off the Wall for its appeal in the 21st century. In 2003, the album was ranked number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The National Association of Recording Merchandisers listed it at number 80 of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. In 2008, "Off the Wall" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.	f

The original album sold between 65 and 100 million copies worldwide, making it the world's best selling album of all time. The prospect of a "second chapter" to Thriller was first publicly discussed on Access Hollywood in late 2006. Jackson said he would discuss the idea with collaborator will.i.am. It was released in Australia on February 8, 2008, internationally on February 11, 2008, and in the United States on February 12, 2008 by Epic Records, Legacy Recordings and MJJ Productions.\n\nThriller 25 was released by Sony BMG's re-issue division, Legacy Recordings. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC gave it a '15' certificate because it included the video for "Thriller". It is the first Jackson album with an age certificate. Along with the original material, the reissue contained remixes, new material, a DVD and collaborations with several contemporary artists.\n\nTwo singles, "The Girl Is Mine 2008" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008", were released from the album to moderate success and a number of the other remixes charted, despite no physical release. Thriller 25 was a commercial success, selling three million copies worldwide in its 12 weeks, and was generally well received among critics, despite their view that the new material was not as inspiring as the original.	f
1261	52	Dangerous	1991-11-21	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/93a5354699d552666448e1c87c976605/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Dangerous was the first album Michael Jackson released in the 1990s, on November 26, 1991. It became his third best-selling album and second to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, where it spent the next 4 weeks - selling 8 million copies in the US. With sales of approximately 30 million copies worldwide, it is Jackson's best-selling recording of the nineties and near ties with Bad as his second-best selling album, behind Thriller.\n\nAccording to the sleeve notes on the later remastered edition of the album, recording sessions began in Los Angeles, California at Ocean Way/Record One  Studio 2 on June 25, 1990. The sessions ended at Larrabee North and Ocean Way Studio on October 29, 1991, being the most extensive recording project of Jackson's career at the time (over 16 months compared to the usual 6 spent for his previous three studio albums).\n\nIn March 1991, Jackson signed a 15 year, 6 album deal to Sony Music. The press reported that Sony actually handed over $1 billion to Jackson, but that was not the case. At the time, Sony estimated that if the albums Jackson released under the new contract sold at the same level they currently sold, it would generate over $1 billion in profits for them. Additionally, Jackson was awarded the highest royalty rate in the business. By the time the contract expired in March 2006, Michael would have been paid $45 million from Sony ($1 million a year, plus $5 million per album delivered). This does not include money he would have also earned from sales of albums, singles, videos etc. Under this contract, Jackson is estimated to have earned $175 million from album sales alone.\n\nAt this point, Dangerous was already in the making, under the producing talents of (Quincy Jones recommended) 23-year-old Teddy Riley and Grammy-winner Bill Bottrell. The previous album, Bad, was Jackson's last designed for the LP industry, conforming to the usual 10-song within 50-minute format, whereas Dangerous was a 77-minute, 14-track compilation, which almost dared the capacity of early Nineties compact discs. Consequently, the record was released as a double album in vinyl.\n\nDangerous was a highly anticipated album, as shown by an incident at the Los Angeles International Airport, where a group of armed robbers stole 30,000 copies before its official release. Because of this, more early copies of the album were released in several countries on November 21 followed by the official November 26 release date.\n\nThe album is also well known for the cover's mysterious nature.It's also known for the number of occult symbols.(eg: the world upside down in the middle) A special limited-edition of the album was initially released in a large box with a picture of Jackson's eyes, which folded open to reveal the normal cover (painted by pop surrealist Mark Ryden), in pop-up card, with the CD and booklet in the bottom.\n\nDangerous was released on November 26, 1991 with record-breaking sales. Dangerous  was Jackson's fastest-selling album ever in the United States with seven million shipped in under two months. This broke the sales record for Bad, which had also shipped seven million copies in 1987, but in twice as many months.\n\nDangerous debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200 Album Charts, with 326,500 copies sold in its first week. It held the position for four weeks until being replaced by Nirvana's Nevermind; the switch has been cited as an important signal helping to break alternative rock into the mainstream. Jackson helped promote the album with a high-profile performance at the Super Bowl and an interview with Oprah Winfrey, but it did not return to the #1 slot. However, it returned to the Top Ten after Jackson received the Grammy Legend Award at the 1993 ceremony. Dangerous spent 117 weeks inside the Billboard 200, thirty weeks more than Bad. The RIAA certified Dangerous 8x platinum, for shipping 8 million copies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album debuted at #1, holding off U2's Achtung Baby, but in the second week it was replaced by Queen's Greatest Hits II. Dangerous spent 23 weeks in the Top 10, and a total of 96 weeks on the Top 75 chart.\n\n"Black or White" was produced and co-written by Bill Bottrell. The single was Jackson's biggest hit since 1983's "Billie Jean". In all, nine singles were released, spanning two years (1991-1993). A planned single release of the title track "Dangerous" was canceled in late 1993 due to the child molestation allegations. Seven singles reached the UK Top 10, the most for any Jackson album.\n\n48% of Bad's worldwide sales were in the UK and US; for Dangerous, the total was 33%, reflecting Jackson's growing global reach. For the most part, the singles from Dangerous were bigger hits in Europe and Australia than in the United States. Dangerous sold very well in both Asia and South America, two emerging and growing record markets, and was supported by the Dangerous World Tour. Prior to the release of Jackson's next studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, Dangerous had already sold over twenty-two million copies worldwide.bIn the space of 17 years, sources estimate the record has sold between 30 and 32 million copies worldwide making it a faster selling album than his previous record Bad.\n\nThe album was included at number 115 on the list of the "Definitive 200" albums of all time developed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers.\n\nAs was becoming the standard for Jackson, the album's music videos were among the most costly and innovative of their time. Several of the music videos taken from the Dangerous  album had complex storylines and dance sequences, and featured cameo appearances by celebrities. The video for "Jam", directed by David Kellogg, showed Jackson and Michael Jordan playing basketball and dancing together, while "Remember the Time", directed by John Singleton, was set in an Ancient Egyptian palace, and starred Eddie Murphy, Magic Johnson and Iman. "In the Closet" featured Jackson and supermodel Naomi Campbell as lovers. The director of the video was photographer Herb Ritts, who also photographed Jackson in a series of promotional shots for the release of the Dangerous album. The video clip for "Who Is It" is notable as it was directed by David Fincher who later went on direct a number of films including Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac. For the video "Give Into Me", Michael appears in a concert setting, featuring Guns N Roses guitarist Slash.\n\n"Black or White" was originally over ten minutes long, premiering simultaneously on November 14, 1991 on MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox. The video featured one of the earliest examples of computer-generated morphing. The last four minutes of the video also induced much controversy, as it depicted Jackson smashing store windows and destroying a car with a crowbar. Jackson said this destructive behaviour was intended to imply a message of anti-racism and racist graffiti was added in later versions to make the violence more understandable. The music video was also controversial because of Jackson's sexually suggestive dance, which included the crotch grab as well as zipping up his pants. MTV and the other music video networks decided to excise the last four minutes of the "Black or White" video for all subsequent airings, and Jackson issued a statement apologizing to anyone who had been offended, and explaining that he tried to interpret the animal instinct of panthers into a dance. The video featured Macaulay Culkin and an appearance during the morphing scene by young Tyra Banks and was directed by John Landis, also the director of the "Thriller" short film.\n\nAlternative editions of the albums became very rare, products almost exclusive for record collectors. The most notable editions were a 1992 edition that folded out to become a diorama, a 1993 Japan remix compilation and a 1993 Australia two-disc edition that contained bonus remixes.\n\nAn international re-release of the album (entitled Dangerous: Special Edition) took place on October 16, 2001, just two weeks before the release of Jackson's studio album Invincible. Simultaneously, Special Editions of Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad were also released. For the occasion, Dangerous was digitally remastered and included a slipcase and a brand new 24-page colorful booklet with revised artwork and previously-unseen photos. The new edition managed to reach #108 in the UK charts (the only one of those four re-releases that didn't enter the Top 75 there). Because of the constraints of Dangerous' running time, previously unreleased songs were not included. Originally, Dangerous: Special Edition was to be released as a double disc release, the 1st disc featuring the original 14 track album, the 2nd filled with unreleased tracks. This project was scrapped at the last moment, however many of the tracks were eventually leaked onto the internet along with various demos of other tracks that appeared on the album. In 2004, some of these leaked tracks were officially released on The Ultimate Collection (namely the "Dangerous" (Early Version) and "Monkey Business").	f

It was released on August 31, 1987 by Epic/CBS Records. The record was released nearly five years after his last studio album Thriller. 20 years after its release, the album has sold over 35 million copies worldwide, and shipped 10 million units in the United States. Bad is the first album ever to feature five Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles.\n\nJackson began recording demos for the anticipated follow-up to Thriller a few months after his last performance with The Jacksons after their successful Victory Tour. Recording took place between November 1986 and July 9, 1987 (except for "Another Part of Me" which was recorded for Captain EO in 1986). Jackson wrote a reported sixty songs for the new album and recorded thirty, wanting to use them all on a three-disc set. Instead his longtime producer Quincy Jones cut it down to ten tracks and a bonus song making it a single LP. The CD release contained the bonus track, "Leave Me Alone". Jackson wrote nine of the eleven tracks himself while Terry Britten (writer of Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do With It") and Graham Lyle wrote "Just Good Friends" and Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard wrote "Man in the Mirror". Contributions from other musicians included Stevie Wonder who sung a duet with Jackson on "Just Good Friends" while Steve Stevens contributed a guitar solo for "Dirty Diana". Originally Jones wanted "Bad" to have been a duet between Jackson and Prince; but apparently, Prince told him that the song "would be a hit without (him) on it". Years later, Prince (jokingly) explained his reason for declining was over either artist singing the song's "your butt is mine" lyric. Another song, "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", was also supposed to feature a famous female singer. Reportedly Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston all turned down the duet offer. R&B singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett was picked by Quincy Jones to sing with him on the song. According to Jones, song choices were difficult. For instance: he and Jackson deliberated over two MJ compositions intended for the album. One: "Streetwalker" favoured by the artist, and Jones' choice: "Another Part of Me". Jones said the dilemma was decided by Jackson's portly manager Frank DiLeo "shaking his butt" to "Another Part of Me". Jones joked: Jackson verbally chastised DiLeo, who he nicknamed "Rubba", for it.\n\nBy the time Jackson released this album, sales of its predecessor, Thriller, had already reached forty million, raising expectations for Bad. Bad became the first of Jackson's albums to debut at number-one on the Billboard 200 where it remained for the next six consecutive weeks. The RIAA certified Bad for having sold eight million copies in the U.S. alone. In the U.K, the album sold 500,000 copies in just five days and is currently certified 13x platinum, for sales of 3.9 million making it Jackson's biggest-selling album in the UK. Globally, it's Jackson's overall third best-selling recording, behind "Thriller" and "Dangerous", with 30 million copies sold.\n\nJackson set another record with this album, becoming the first - and currently, only artist to have five songs to hit number-one from one album. In July 2006, it was announced by the The Official UK Charts Company that Bad was the ninth biggest selling album in British history. It turned out to be the last collaborative effort by Jackson and Jones, as Jackson moved on to write and produce more of his own records, particularly with Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Rodney Jerkins.\n\nRolling Stone stated that "even without a milestone recording like "Billie Jean", Bad is still a better record than Thriller." The magazine further went on to say that the "filler" content in Bad - including songs such as "Speed Demon", "Dirty Diana" and "Liberian Girl" - is written by Jackson himself, making Bad "richer, sexier and better than Thriller's forgettables."\n\nDespite the records success, in a poll of 23,000 US citizens, released by Rolling Stone, Jackson won "worst album" for Bad and "worst single" for "Bad". TIME gave the opinion that the singer was suffering a backlash in certain parts of the US. The publication suggested that the singer's media image was triggering the poll, not the music.\n\nIn 2001, a special edition was released with three new songs and a new booklet containing lyrics and never-before-seen photos.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 202 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.	f

It was Jackson's fifth album released through Epic Records, and the first released on his label MJJ Productions. The album was Jackson's first studio album since his 1991 album Dangerous nearly four years prior. HIStory consists of two discs: the first, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits compilation; the second, HIStory Continues, comprises new material written and produced by Jackson and collaborators. The themes include environmental awareness, isolation, greed, suicide, injustice, and Jackson's conflicts with the media.\n\nHIStory attracted some controversy. Jackson rerecorded some lyrics in "They Don't Care About Us" after he was accused of antisemitism, and contributor R. Kelly was accused of having plagiarized one of the album's songs, "You Are Not Alone", leading to its banning on Belgian radio.\n\nHIStory debuted at number one in countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, France and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top ten in Spain, India and Mexico. By 1997 it had been certified six times platinum in Europe, making it the best-selling album of the year in the combined European market. The album received generally positive reviews and was nominated for five Grammy Awards, winning one for Best Music Video – Short Form for "Scream".\n\nSix singles and one promotional single were released from HIStory: "Scream/Childhood", "You Are Not Alone", "Earth Song", "This Time Around", "They Don't Care About Us" and "Stranger in Moscow", with "Smile" being released for promotional purposes only. "Earth Song", "They Don't Care About Us" and "Stranger in Moscow" peaked in the top ten in multiple countries, but were less successful within the United States. The greatest hits disc was reissued as a single disc on November 13, 2001, under the title Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I and had sold four million copies worldwide by 2010. The second disc was released separately in some European countries in 2011. As of 2010, HIStory has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and is the best selling multiple-disc release, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.	f

His last studio album, it was the first release of new Jackson material since Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix in 1997 and the first studio album in six years since HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, Book I. Jackson, Rodney Jerkins, R. Kelly, and Teddy Riley received producing and writing credits, among others. Similar to Jackson's previous material, Invincible explores themes such as love, romance, isolation, media criticism, and social issues. Invincible received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album's singles were incomplete in their release. Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.\n \nThree singles were released from the album: "You Rock My World," "Cry," and "Butterflies," of which the first and second were released as physical singles internationally (except the USA) and the third one being a US-only radio-airplay single. The album's first and last singles charted within the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and they peaked at number one and within the top ten in several markets worldwide; "Cry" was less commercially successful. Following a conflict between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music stopped promoting the album. The album was the recipient of one Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, as well as being voted, by readers of Billboard magazine, the best album of the decade.\n \nThe album peaked at number one in eleven territories worldwide, including the United States (with sales of 363,000 units its first week), the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Switzerland. Invincible charted within the top ten in six other territories; its least successful charting area was Mexico, where the album peaked at number twenty nine. Invincible re-entered music charts several times during the decade. Despite selling 13 million copies worldwide, the album has been viewed as a commercial failure compared to Jackson's previous albums sales.	f

The album was primarily recorded at The Village in Los Angeles.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, Styles announced the album's lead single to be "Sign of the Times", which was released on 7 April. The album name, artwork, and track list were revealed on 13 April. The album track "Sweet Creature" was released as a promotional single on 2 May. Styles performed the songs "Sign of the Times" and "Ever Since New York" on the 15 April episode of Saturday Night Live. On 21 April, Styles appeared on The Graham Norton Show for his first televised solo performance in his native country, and guested on the French talk show, Quotidien, five days later; he performed "Sign of the Times" on both shows.\n\nOn 9 May, Styles performed the tracks "Carolina", "Sign of the Times", "Ever Since New York", and a cover of One Direction's "Stockholm Syndrome" on The Today Show. On 13 May, a day after the album's release, he held a surprise concert at The Garage in London. Styles held a similar show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on 19 May, and invited Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks to perform as a special guest. Proceeds from both shows were donated to charity. On 15 May, Harry Styles: Behind the Album was released exclusively on Apple Music, a 49-minute documentary film showing footage from his writing and recording sessions in Jamaica and Los Angeles; The Performances version features a full-length live performance of the album filmed at London's Abbey Road Studios. Styles was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with James Corden every night in the week spanning from 15 to 18 May, and performed in various sketches alongside Corden. In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first solo tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, which ran from September 2017 through to July 2018 and visited North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America. On tour, Styles debuted two unreleased songs, "Oh Anna" and "Medicine", which were originally written for the album.\n\n"A lot of my influences, and the stuff that I love, is older... I didn't want to put out my first album and be like, 'He's tried to re-create the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties.' Loads of amazing music was written then, but I'm not saying I wish I lived back then. I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 230,000 album-equivalent units, of which 193,000 were pure album sales. It is the highest first sales week for a British male artist's debut full-length album since Nielsen SoundScan began in 1991. Selling 67,000 units in its second week, it fell down to number three.\n\nThe album was ranked number 22 on the list of the top 40 biggest albums of 2017 on the UK Album Chart. It was the fourth best selling album by a British artist worldwide in 2017. According to IFPI, it was the ninth best selling album of 2017, with 1 million copies shipped globally. The album was Sony Music's biggest global seller in the second quarter of 2017. It was the sixth best selling album of 2017 in Mexico.\n\n"Sign of the Times" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the song debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single, "Two Ghosts", peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart and number 34 on the US Mainstream Top 40 charts.	f

It was written by Styles alongside its producers Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon. Erskine Records and Columbia Records released the song for digital download and streaming on 11 October 2019 as the album's lead single. Musically, "Lights Up" is a pop and R&B song, featuring multilayered guitars, piano, programmed beats, and a gospel choir. Conceived by Styles after a period of self-reflection, the lyrics are about self-discovery and him embracing his own identity.\n\nCritics found Styles's musical direction refreshing and commented on the song's unconventional structure which is composed of several breakdown pre-choruses and post-choruses, and a single chorus. A few others criticised the song as forgettable. In the UK, the single reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also peaked in the top 20 and received Platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, and the US. Vincent Haycock directed the song's music video, which features Styles dancing shirtless in a sweat-drenched crowd of people.	f

I wanted to do something that sounds like me."\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016.

Other popular singles include "Lights" and "Wheel in the Sky", the latter written by temporary front man Fleischman.\n\nJourney's manager, Herbie Herbert, enlisted producer Roy Thomas Baker to engineer Infinity. This produced a layered sound approach, similar to his work with Queen, as demonstrated on tracks such as "Winds of March". In addition, Baker's method of stacked harmonies, notable on several other albums he produced, would become trademarks of Journey's sound. Baker achieved this by having each vocalist (usually Perry and Rolie, sometimes joined by Valory and/or Schon) sing each harmony part in unison. This had the effect of making three or four voices sound like more, and is notable on the songs "Feeling that Way" and "Anytime," which are often played consecutively on radio stations.	f

It was released on May 20, 2022. Its hit lead single that went #1 on all platforms, "As It Was" was released on April 1, 2022. Harry's House debuted at #1  on the U.S. Apple Music album charts. It is also the first album in Spotify history to have all of its tracks surpass 5M streams on its first day.\n\nThe album is the product of a chain reaction. Had the pandemic not thrown his world into a tailspin in early 2020, he would’ve continued to tour behind Fine Line, his critically adored sophomore album, and played its songs hundreds of times for sold-out crowds around the world. A return to the studio was planned, of course, but when COVID-19 canceled those plans too, Styles faced an empty calendar for the first time in a decade. The singer opted to use this free time carefully, taking a solo road trip through Italy and visiting with family and friends for rare long, drawn-out stretches. It was an important moment of reevaluation. “You miss so many birthdays,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And eventually it's just assumed you're unable to be at stuff. Finally I was like, ‘I want to balance my life out a bit. Working isn’t who I am, it's something I do. I want to be able to put that down.’”\n\nHis upbeat, lightly electronic third LP riffs on the concept of home, viewing it less as a geographical location and more as a state of mind—his mind. “Imagine it’s a day in my house, a day in my mind,” he said. “What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff.” Because of the pandemic, Styles recorded the songs with a small handful of longtime friends and close collaborators who gathered in a single room to drink wine, write, and play. That intimacy is reflected in the songs, which are conversational and casually confessional, as if he’s thinking out loud. Blending vintage folk rock with flickers of disco and a generally more relaxed sensibility, they illustrate a turning point in Styles’ career as he transitions even further towards career singer-songwriter. “For a while it was, how do I play that game of remaining exciting?” he says. “But I finally had a moment where I felt like, ‘Okay, I’m not the young thing, so I would like to really think about who I want to be as a musician.’”\n\nHarry's House won the Grammy for Album of the Year in February of 2023.	f

The album's themes involve the initial excitement of meeting someone, breakups, and "having sex and feeling sad", as Styles has said himself. The record has been described as pop rock, with elements of prog-pop, psychedelic pop, folk, soul, funk and indie pop.\n\nSupported by five singles—"Lights Up", "Adore You", "Falling", "Watermelon Sugar" and "Golden"—"Fine Line" debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the Billboard 200, making it Styles' second consecutive number-one album in the US. The album had the third-largest sales week of 2019 in the US and broke the record as the biggest debut from a British male artist since Nielsen SoundScan began, earning 478,000 album-equivalent units. It has been certified platinum in the US for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over one million units in the country.\n\n"Fine Line" received generally positive reviews from music critics, particularly towards its production and stylistic influences. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2020 Brit Awards, and is nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2021 Grammy Awards. The album has also received Grammy Award nominations for "Watermelon Sugar" in the Best Pop Solo Performance category and "Adore You" in the Best Music Video category. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it number 491 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, making it the most recent album to be included.	f

It is the seventh Australian and sixth internationally released studio album by the band.\n\nReleased on 25 July 1980, Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who died on 19 February at the age of 33, and was dedicated to him. The band considered disbanding following his death, but they ultimately decided to continue, with encouragement from Scott's parents, and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce. The album was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, and Electric Lady Studios in New York, where the album was also mixed.\n\nBack in Black was originally mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk, New York. It was remastered and re-released in 1994, then again as part of the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC Remasters series in 2003 by George Marino. In addition, a DualDisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.\n\nAs of June 2011, the album has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide, making it tied for second highest-selling album of all time, the highest-selling album by a band (together with Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon), the best-selling hard rock album of all-time, and the best-selling album ever released by an Australian musical act. On 13 December 2007, the RIAA certified it 22x multi-platinum, recognizing sales of 22 million in the US, making it the sixth-highest-selling album in the US (fourth-highest at the time). "Back in Black" is the 77th album in the ranking "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" of the American magazine Rolling Stone.	f

It is also AC/DC's fifth international studio album. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. It was the last album featuring Bon Scott, who died early the following year.\n\nThe album has ten tracks:\n\n1. "Highway to Hell" – 3:28\n2. "Girls Got Rhythm" – 3:23\n3. "Walk All Over You" – 5:10\n4. "Touch Too Much" – 4:27\n5. "Beating Around the Bush" – 3:56\n6. "Shot Down in Flames" – 3:22\n7. "Get It Hot" – 2:34\n8. "If You Want Blood (You've Got It)" – 4:37\n9. "Love Hungry Man" – 4:17\n10. "Night Prowler" – 6:27\n\nAll songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released by Albert Productions, who licensed the album to Atlantic Records for release outside of Australia, and was then re-released by Epic Records in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. On May 25th 2006, Highway To Hell was certified 7x platinum by the RIAA. In 2003, the album was ranked number 199 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. \n\n\n\n\nOverview\nHighway to Hell is the last AC/DC album recorded with lead vocalist Bon Scott before his death in February 1980. The final words spoken by Scott on the album are "Shazbot, na-nu na-nu," phrases used on the then-popular American sitcom, Mork and Mindy, by lead character Mork (a visiting extraterrestrial played by Robin Williams).\n\nHighway to Hell was the first AC/DC album not produced by Harry Vanda and George Young. Pre-production of the album began in January 1979 with demos cut at Albert Studios in Sydney, Australia, where they met the intended producer, Eddie Kramer. Kramer was fired before a single track had been completed, and Robert John "Mutt" Lange was brought in to replace him. The change proved to be fortuitous, with Lange also producing the band's biggest sellers, Back in Black and For Those About to Rock. The album was recorded during sessions in February 1979 at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida and March-April at Roundhouse Studios in London, England.\n\nIn Australia, Highway to Hell was released with a slightly different album cover, featuring flames and a drawing of a bass guitar neck superimposed over the same group photo used on the international cover. Additionally, the East German release had different and much plainer designs on the front and back, apparently because the authorities were not happy with the sleeve as released elsewhere.\n\nPersonnel\nBon Scott – lead vocals \nAngus Young – lead guitar \nMalcolm Young – rhythm guitar, backing vocals \nCliff Williams – bass, backing vocals \nPhil Rudd – drums \nRobert John "Mutt" Lange – producer \nMark Dearnley – engineer \n\nChart positions\nBillboard Music Charts (North America) - album\n\n1979 Pop Albums No. 1 \nBillboard (North America) - singles\n\n1979 Highway To Hell Pop Singles No. 2 \n1992 Highway To Hell(Live) Mainstream Rock Tracks No. 11	f

The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nLet There Be Rock is the last AC/DC recording to feature bassist Mark Evans, who previously played on the international versions of High Voltage (May 1976) and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (December 1976).\n\nAs with AC/DC's previous albums, there were differences between the international and Australian edition of Let There Be Rock, released in March 1977. For the US market (and later for the CD releases), the Australian version's racy "Crabsody In Blue" was replaced with a shortened version of "Problem Child" from AC/DC's Dirty Deeds Done Cheap, released in September 1976. The international version also has a slightly modified track order.\n\nAdditionally, the international version of Let There Be Rock featured a different cover from that of the original. This cover marked the debut of AC/DC's classic logo. The Australian edition was eventually repackaged with the international version's cover, marking the first time an Australian AC/DC album cover was matched to its corresponding international edition.\n\nIn 1980, AC/DC released a live concert motion picture entitled AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. In 1997, an expanded audio recording of this concert was released on CD as Let There Be Rock: The Movie, on discs 2-3 of the Bonfire box set.\n\nThe title track, "Let There Be Rock" will mark the band's music video game debut when it is featured in the upcoming rhythm game Rock Band 2.\n\n\n Track listing\n"Go Down" – 5:18 (vinyl), 5:31 (CD) \n"Dog Eat Dog" – 3:34 \n"Let There Be Rock" – 6:06 \n"Bad Boy Boogie" – 4:27 \n"Problem Child" – 5:24 \n"Overdose" – 6:09 \n"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be" – 4:21 \n"Whole Lotta Rosie" – 5:24 \nAll songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. \nMost CD releases feature this track listing along with a slightly longer version of "Go Down". \nTrack 5 ("Problem Child") originally released on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap in 1976. This is a shortened version of the original. \nFor the original vinyl release, in all markets other than the USA and Japan, "Crabsody In Blue" was featured instead of "Problem Child". \n\nPersonnel\nBon Scott - lead vocals \nAngus Young - lead guitar \nMalcolm Young - rhythm guitar, bass, backing vocals \nMark Evans - bass \nPhil Rudd - drums \nCliff Williams- bass (Tour and "Let There Be Rock" video) \n\nProduction\nProducers: Harry Vanda, George Young \nEngineer: Mark Opitz \nMastering supervisor: Michael Fraser, Al Quaglieri \nMastering: George Marino \nDigital assembly: Eugene Nastasi \nArt direction: Bob Defrin \nLiner notes: Murray Engleheart \n\nCharts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1977 Pop Albums 154	f

It is also AC/DC's fourth international studio album. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released on Atlantic Records, and reached #133 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart in the US, eventually going platinum there. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\n\n \n\n\n Overview\nPowerage is the first AC/DC album to be released nearly simultaneously in both Australian and international markets, and the first to use just one cover image for both. It was also the first to feature the same track listing on all versions, with the exception of European vinyl editions. These included "Cold Hearted Man", a song that has not been officially released on any other AC/DC album, and some omitted "Rock 'n' Roll Damnation".\n\nPowerage marked the studio debut of bassist Cliff Williams. It was the band's last Bon Scott-era studio release to feature production work by Harry Vanda and George Young.\n\n\n Track listing\n\n Australian / US & all CD releases\n"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation" – 3:37 \n"Down Payment Blues" – 6:03 \n"Gimme a Bullet" – 3:21 \n"Riff Raff" – 5:11 \n"Sin City" – 4:45 \n"What's Next to the Moon" – 3:31 \n"Gone Shootin'" – 5:05 \n"Up to My Neck in You" – 4:13 \n"Kicked in the Teeth" – 4:03 \nSome cassette copies, such as the original Canadian issue had an alternate track listing. For example, "Sin City" was the first song on side 1, while "Rock 'n' Roll Damnation" was the first song on side 2. All other tracks appear in the order of the original Australian/US release. \n\nEuropean LP release\n"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation" – 3:05 \n"Gimme A Bullet" – 3:00 \n"Down Payment Blues" – 5:50 \n"Gone Shootin'" – 4:19 \n"Riff Raff" – 5:13 \n"Sin City" – 4:47 \n"Up to My Neck in You" – 4:58 \n"What's Next to the Moon" – 3:15 \n"Cold Hearted Man" – 3:34 \n"Kicked in the Teeth" – 3:45 \nAll songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. \nInitial editions of the European LP release featured a different mix of the album. It had a 'harder' sound than the later version, with small variations in vocals and/or guitar tracks, and occasionally extra sections and longer or shorter fades. This version omitted "Rock 'n' Roll Damnation from the tracklist. The first cassette issue of the album also features this mix. \nThe album was later remixed for the American market, with that new mix replacing the original European mix, and becoming the global standard. That mix is still used on all AC/DC 'Powerage' CD releases today. \n\nPersonnel\nBon Scott - lead vocals \nAngus Young - lead guitar \nMalcolm Young - rhythm guitar, backing vocals \nCliff Williams - bass, backing vocals \nPhil Rudd - drums \nProduction\nProducers: Harry Vanda, George Young \nEngineer: Mark Opitz	f

All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\nOriginally released on Atlantic Records, it peaked at #3 and is currently certified 6x platinum by the RIAA. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\n\n \nOverview\nThis edition of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is considerably different from the original Australian edition released in September 1976, featuring a different cover and track order.\n\nOn this album, the Australian version's "R.I.P. (Rock in Peace)" and "Jailbreak" are replaced by "Rocker" (from 1975's T.N.T.) and "Love at First Feel", the latter being one of only two tracks from international AC/DC albums not available on the band's Australian albums. (The other is "Cold Hearted Man", released on European pressings of Powerage.) Conversely, several songs that are available on Australian AC/DC albums have not seen overseas release. However, "Love at First Feel" was released in Australia as a single.\n\nThough the international album was released by Atlantic Records in Europe in 1976 it was not picked up for U.S. release at the time. Following the American success of Highway To Hell in late 1979 import copies of the album, began to appear as imports in the U.S. Some of these imports were the original Australian edition on Albert Productions. However Atlantic Records also pressed the international version in Australia and many of these copies were also exported to the U.S. Strong demand for both import versions eventually led the U.S. division of Atlantic to finally authorize an official U.S. release in April 1981 which went straight to #3 on the Billboard album charts.\n\nTwo songs on the international album were edited from the full length versions on the original Australian album. The full length "Dirty Deeds" has the title of the song chanted 4 times starting at 3:09, but on the edited version the chant is heard only 2 times. "Ain't No Fun" lasted 7:29 on the Australian album but was faded out early to 6:57 on the international version. However, both these full length versions were restored on the 1994 Atco Records remastered CD of the international album. The most recent 2003 CD edition on Epic Records goes back to the edited versions as on the 1976 and 1981 international vinyl editions.\n\nAdditionally, a song titled "I'm a Rebel" was recorded during the Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap sessions in September 1976, with music and lyrics written by Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother, Alex Young. This song was never released and remains in Albert Productions' vaults.\n\nAngus came up with the title of the album when he was watching an episode of Beany And Cecil. The antagonist, Dishonest John, carried a card that read: "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Special Holidays, Sundays and Rates".\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott.\n\n\nSide A\n"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" – 4:11 (full length version) 3:52 (edited version) \n"Love at First Feel" – 3:13 \n"Big Balls" – 2:39 \n"Rocker" – 2:52 \n"Problem Child" – 5:47 \n\nSide B\n"There's Gonna Be Some Rockin'" – 3:18 \n"Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)" – 7:29 (full length version), 6:58 (edited version) \n"Ride On" – 5:54 \n"Squealer" – 5:27 \nMost editions of this album contain edited versions of the title track and "Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)." The 1994 remastered CD on Atco Records contains full length versions of both songs. \nThe track "Rocker" was originally released on T.N.T. in 1975. \n\nPersonnel\nBon Scott – lead vocals \nAngus Young – lead guitar/backing vocals on 1 \nMalcolm Young – rhythm guitar, backing vocals \nMark Evans – bass guitar/backing vocals on 2-9 \nPhil Rudd – drums \n\n Production\nProducers: Harry Vanda, George Young \nMastering supervisors: Michael Fraser, Al Quaglieri \nDigital remastering: George Marino \nDigital assembly: Eugene Nastasi \nCover design: Hipgnosis \nSleeve photo: Paul Canty \nPhotography: Hipgnosis, Philip Morris, Michael Putland, Neil Zlozower \n\n Charts\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1981 Pop Albums 3 \n\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\n\nYear Single Chart Position \n1981 "Big Balls" Mainstream Rock 26 \n1981 "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" Mainstream Rock 4	f

The album was a follow-up to their highly successful album Back in Black. For Those About to Rock has sold over 4 million copies in the US. It was AC/DC's first and only No. 1 album in the USA until the release of Black Ice in October 2008. In their original 1981 review, Rolling Stone magazine declared it to be their best album.\n\nThe album was the third and final produced for the band by Robert John "Mutt" Lange.\n\nThe name of the album was inspired by a book Angus Young read, entitled For Those About To Die, We Salute You, about Roman gladiators. The gladiators' final words to the emperor were "Ave Caesar morituri te salutant" - or, "Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you." The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nRecorded in a rehearsal space on the outskirts of Paris. The band had found it difficult to come up with their desired sound while on their previous rehearsing location (an abandoned factory in France).\n\nThe album became AC/DC's first US No. 1 album. After its release the band embarked on its first arena tour of North America (late 1981 through early 1982). For the title track, large cannons were placed on stage, set to go off in accordance with the song on the album.\n\nIn Spain, early copies of the album featured a sleeve with the colours reversed, i.e., a gold cannon on a black background.\n\nThe title track's popularity was such that in every live concert AC/DC has done thereafter, the song is performed as an encore and is always accompanied by firing cannons on stage.\n\nIt was re-released in 2003 in CD format. That edition consisted of digitally remastered material from the original masters.\n\nFor Those About to Rock was also the name of a movie including live performances by AC/DC, as well as Metallica, The Black Crowes, and Pantera.\n\n    * In the video game Guitar Hero II, the Gibson SG's description has a line which reads: "For those about to rock, we... give you the Gibson SG".\n    * On Nintendo's website, the ad for the Wii version of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock states "For those about to rock, Wii salute you". This tagline is also seen in the music store for Rock Band 2 Wii users.\n    * In the movie School of Rock, Jack Black says to the class: "In the words of AC/DC: We roll tonight... to the guitar bite... and for those about to rock... I salute you"\n    * The album was referenced by Beastie Boys on their 1989 single "Shadrach."\n    * ESPN uses it for their college football coverage.\n    * Artie Lange, sidekick on Howard Stern's radio program, frequently references Brian Johnson's exclamation of "FIRE!!" from the title track.\n    * WBCN often uses the opening guitar notes of the title track as segue ways into and out of commercials during New England Patriots radio broadcasts.	f

King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to "Who Made Flu." Three tracks on the album — "Who Made Who" and the instrumentals "D.T." and "Chase the Ace" — were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums.

Three tracks on the album — "Who Made Who" and the instrumentals "D.T." and "Chase the Ace" — were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums.

The album was recorded at the Miraval Studio in Le Val, France in between August and September 1987.\n\nThe album was produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, the production team behind the band's early albums. This was also the final studio album to feature drummer Simon Wright.\n\nThe album was the band's biggest-selling album of new material since For Those About To Rock, We Salute You, being certified Platinum in the US. Blow Up Your Video reached #2 in the UK and #12 in the US. However, the band played four tracks from it on the subsequent world tour, "Heatseeker", "That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll", "Nick of Time", and "Go Zone" -- "Heatseeker" and "That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll" are also featured on AC/DC Live Collector's Edition. "Heatseeker" was a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. During the Blow Up Your Video world tour, Malcolm Young decided not to participate in touring because he wanted to get over an alcohol addiction. Filling in for him was Malcolm and Angus' nephew, Stevie Young, although Malcolm is present in the Blow Up Your Video promotional videos.\n\nSeveral outtakes from the recording sessions include several songs not on the album called, "Let It Loose", and "Alright Tonight", as well as other versions of "Heatseeker", and "That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll".\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Malcolm Young, Angus Young and Brian Johnson.\n\n"Heatseeker" – 3:50 \n"That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll" – 3:43 \n"Meanstreak" – 4:08 \n"Go Zone" – 4:26 \n"Kissin' Dynamite" – 3:58 \n"Nick of Time" – 4:16 \n"Some Sin for Nuthin'" – 4:11 \n"Ruff Stuff" – 4:34 \n"Two's Up" – 5:25 \n"This Means War" – 4:23 \nTwo additional songs, "Snake Eye" and "Borrowed Time", were recorded but only released on the 12" single versions of "Heatseeker" and "That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll" respectively.

It was released on October 2, 2020, and was previewed through a trailer with narration by Morgan Freeman. The album serves as a sequel to the duo's extended play Savage Mode (2016). It features guest appearances by Drake, Young Thug, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. On October 19, 2020, a chopped and screwed version of the album was released.\n\nSavage Mode II received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, becoming 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one album. It was supported by two singles: "Runnin" and "Mr. Right Now".\n\nMetro Boomin first announced the project in July 2019, after 21 Savage brought him out on stage during a concert. Speaking to the crowd, Metro simply stated that Savage Mode II was on the way. On February 18, 2020, the producer tweeted a photo of himself and Savage in the studio. The caption for the picture read "MODE". On March 3, 21 Savage reposted a fan's Instagram story that the project would be released on March 13. In May, Savage stated that they were making sure the album is "perfect" before being released. The project's release was officially announced on September 28, with the duo confirmed the release date and previewing the album with a horror-themed, "macabre" trailer directed by Gibson Hazard, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman; he recorded his contributions onto his iPhone at his home. The visual contains in-studio scenes of the pair, as Freeman informs viewers of the meaning of "savage mode": "'Savage' is defined as 'fierce, beastly and untamed'. 'Mode' is defined as 'a way of operating or using the system'. So to be in 'savage mode' is to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or deter you from your mission. Basically, this means when someone is in 'savage mode', they're not to be fucked with". The announcement came a week after fans launched a petition urging Savage and Metro to release the album. It garnered over 28,000 signatures.\n\nMetro Boomin unveiled the album cover on September 29 on his social media, with the caption: "Boominati Slaughter Gang taking over for the 2020 and the 21", recalling Juvenile's line "Cash Money Records taking over the 99 and the 2000" from his single "Back That Azz Up". The cover was created by Pen & Pixel, who came out of retirement for the design. It is a "nostalgic" and vintage artwork, "heavily" inspired by those of Cash Money and No Limit Records and is a nod to the "bling rap" album covers of the 1990s.\n\nA promotional website for the album was created, featuring a live countdown to the project's release and a phone number that listeners could call to hear snippets of the tracks.\n\nThe music video for the song, "Runnin", was released on October 2, 2020. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2020, as the album's dual lead single, along with "Mr. Right Now", featuring Canadian rapper Drake, which was serviced to urban contemporary radio. The music video for "My Dawg", was released on October 7, 2020.\n\nSavage Mode II was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nIn a positive review, Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that "As a whole, the album is confirmation of two young artists at the top of their game, watching the landscape unfold from the throne they earned themselves four years ago." Robin Murray of Clash praised the "crisp and future-facing" production from Metro Boomin, as well as the rap performances by 21 Savage. He concluded: "Savage Mode 2 matches ruthless entertainment to phenomenal artistry, a collaboration that works on a number of levels." Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine said, "It's Metro, though, who elevates 21's stories to something approaching greatness. ... This sequel is a ratification of the "bigger and better," an example of steady improvement through impeccable craft." Rashad Grove from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the album, saying, "21 Savage, accompanied by the golden touch of Metro Boomin, have given the hip-hop world their most well-rounded project to date, and they set the bar high for others to measure up to." Paste critic Trey Alston said, "Savage Mode II is a worthy successor to the original, building on that initial moment that made 21 Savage a household name. Adventurous, introspective, and thoughtful, it's just what the world needs from the rapper at this moment, even if we didn't know it." Mark Elibert of HipHopDX said, "The Grammy Award winner shows he continues to be ambitious as an artist while keeping up the Slaughter King mantra he ran with early in his career. For Young Metro, Savage Mode II asserts there's no rust on his boards and proves he's still one of the best architects in the game."\n\nReviewing the album for Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre stated "The first Savage Mode didn't become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews said, "The 44 minutes of this album could exist without Mr. Freeman, but they couldn't exist without Metro Boomin. ...  a solid RAPPER through and through and in an era of singers I'm always going to appreciate that, but if I said I could ignore the banality of Savage Mode II lyrically I'd be lying." In a lukewarm review, Exclaim!'s Jacob Carey wrote, "Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While Savage Mode II is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for."\n\nSavage Mode II debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 171,000 album-equivalent units (including 22,000 pure album sales). This became 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one debut. The album also accumulated a total of 200.1 million on-demand streams of the album's songs during that week.	f

The album features production from frequent collaborator Metro Boomin, alongside Southside, Pi'erre Bourne, Zaytoven, Wheezy, DJ Mustard and 21 Savage himself. It succeeds 21 Savage's collaborative EP with Metro Boomin, Savage Mode (2016).\n\nIssa Album was supported by the lead single, "Bank Account". The album charted at number two on the US Billboard 200, and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nOn February 9, 2017, 21 Savage announced the title of the album. On June 29, 21 Savage revealed the album's cover art, along with the release date. On July 2, 2017, 21 Savage confirmed the album's producers.\n\n"Issa" featuring Young Thug and Drake, was a planned single to be released on Savage's album. On December 19, 2016, Young Thug posted a video confirming that he will collaborate with 21 Savage on his debut studio album. However in May 2017, the original track was leaked online and made many fans unaware of the song being on the album. It is also been confirmed that 21 Savage has scrapped the song from his studio album.\n\nThe album's lead single, "Bank Account", was released to rhythmic contemporary radio on August 8, 2017. The song peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIssa Album was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as 64 out of 100, based on 11 reviews.\n\nIn XXL, Scott Glaysher opined that the artist "manages to craft a fairly concise project with Issa Album about all the things that make him such a compelling rapper in today's hip-hop landscape." Exclaim!'s M.T. Richards wrote that "Savage's strength of feeling against certain people cannot be overstated." Corrigan B of Tiny Mix Tapes noted, "Despite expectations, it's an utter joy to listen to—a simple display of what 21 Savage sounds like when he's having fun rapping." Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote positively, "Issa Album contains some of 21 Savage's best and most fully realized songs to date—especially "Bank Account" and "Bad Business"." Justin Ivey of HipHopDX stated, "The budding star easily could have played it safe and stuck to a winning formula, which remains a strong suit (i.e. Issa's "Bank Account" and "Close My Eyes"). Instead, he challenged himself to be more musically ambitious. While his experiments didn't produce dynamic results, the positives overshadow the negatives."\n\nSteve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews said, "For better or worse the album also achieves a certain bland uniformity at times by staying so true to the trap aesthetic and having Metro Boomin produce so much of the music. It's not ill-conceived, it's just that it all winds up becoming a bit monotonous if you don't randomize it and/or mix in some songs by other artists." Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork states, "He is so compelling when he digs deeper into his psyche this way, providing more than superficiality, but there aren't enough of these moments to sustain Issa Album, which is as basic as its title." In a mixed review, AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung stated: "Overall, Issa is a competent statement that demonstrates promise from the young rapper." Brian Josephs of Spin said, "Issa Album needn't be The Infamous, but it could've benefitted from a clearer and tighter direction." Wren Graves of Consequence of Sound criticized the "repetitive odes to getting high, getting laid, and getting lots of money."\n\nIssa Album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 77,000 album-equivalent units, of which 22,000 were pure album sales. On October 19, 2017, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units.	f

It was released on October 2, 2020, and was previewed through a trailer with narration by Morgan Freeman. The album serves as a sequel to the duo's extended play Savage Mode (2016). It features guest appearances by Drake, Young Thug, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. On October 19, 2020, a chopped and screwed version of the album was released.\n\nSavage Mode II received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, becoming 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one album. It was supported by two singles: "Runnin" and "Mr. Right Now".\n\nMetro Boomin first announced the project in July 2019, after 21 Savage brought him out on stage during a concert. Speaking to the crowd, Metro simply stated that Savage Mode II was on the way. On February 18, 2020, the producer tweeted a photo of himself and Savage in the studio. The caption for the picture read "MODE". On March 3, 21 Savage reposted a fan's Instagram story that the project would be released on March 13. In May, Savage stated that they were making sure the album is "perfect" before being released. The project's release was officially announced on September 28, with the duo confirmed the release date and previewing the album with a horror-themed, "macabre" trailer directed by Gibson Hazard, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman; he recorded his contributions onto his iPhone at his home. The visual contains in-studio scenes of the pair, as Freeman informs viewers of the meaning of "savage mode": "'Savage' is defined as 'fierce, beastly and untamed'. 'Mode' is defined as 'a way of operating or using the system'. So to be in 'savage mode' is to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or deter you from your mission. Basically, this means when someone is in 'savage mode', they're not to be fucked with". The announcement came a week after fans launched a petition urging Savage and Metro to release the album. It garnered over 28,000 signatures.\n\nMetro Boomin unveiled the album cover on September 29 on his social media, with the caption: "Boominati Slaughter Gang taking over for the 2020 and the 21", recalling Juvenile's line "Cash Money Records taking over the 99 and the 2000" from his single "Back That Azz Up". The cover was created by Pen & Pixel, who came out of retirement for the design. It is a "nostalgic" and vintage artwork, "heavily" inspired by those of Cash Money and No Limit Records and is a nod to the "bling rap" album covers of the 1990s.\n\nA promotional website for the album was created, featuring a live countdown to the project's release and a phone number that listeners could call to hear snippets of the tracks.\n\nThe music video for the song, "Runnin", was released on October 2, 2020. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2020, as the album's dual lead single, along with "Mr. Right Now", featuring Canadian rapper Drake, which was serviced to urban contemporary radio. The music video for "My Dawg", was released on October 7, 2020.\n\nSavage Mode II was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nIn a positive review, Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that "As a whole, the album is confirmation of two young artists at the top of their game, watching the landscape unfold from the throne they earned themselves four years ago." Robin Murray of Clash praised the "crisp and future-facing" production from Metro Boomin, as well as the rap performances by 21 Savage. He concluded: "Savage Mode 2 matches ruthless entertainment to phenomenal artistry, a collaboration that works on a number of levels." Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine said, "It's Metro, though, who elevates 21's stories to something approaching greatness. ... This sequel is a ratification of the "bigger and better," an example of steady improvement through impeccable craft." Rashad Grove from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the album, saying, "21 Savage, accompanied by the golden touch of Metro Boomin, have given the hip-hop world their most well-rounded project to date, and they set the bar high for others to measure up to." Paste critic Trey Alston said, "Savage Mode II is a worthy successor to the original, building on that initial moment that made 21 Savage a household name. Adventurous, introspective, and thoughtful, it's just what the world needs from the rapper at this moment, even if we didn't know it." Mark Elibert of HipHopDX said, "The Grammy Award winner shows he continues to be ambitious as an artist while keeping up the Slaughter King mantra he ran with early in his career. For Young Metro, Savage Mode II asserts there's no rust on his boards and proves he's still one of the best architects in the game."\n\nReviewing the album for Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre stated "The first Savage Mode didn't become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews said, "The 44 minutes of this album could exist without Mr. Freeman, but they couldn't exist without Metro Boomin. ...  a solid RAPPER through and through and in an era of singers I'm always going to appreciate that, but if I said I could ignore the banality of Savage Mode II lyrically I'd be lying." In a lukewarm review, Exclaim!'s Jacob Carey wrote, "Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While Savage Mode II is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for."\n\nSavage Mode II debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 171,000 album-equivalent units (including 22,000 pure album sales). This became 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one debut. The album also accumulated a total of 200.1 million on-demand streams of the album's songs during that week.	f

Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine said, "It's Metro, though, who elevates 21's stories to something approaching greatness. ... This sequel is a ratification of the "bigger and better," an example of steady improvement through impeccable craft." Rashad Grove from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the album, saying, "21 Savage, accompanied by the golden touch of Metro Boomin, have given the hip-hop world their most well-rounded project to date, and they set the bar high for others to measure up to." Paste critic Trey Alston said, "Savage Mode II is a worthy successor to the original, building on that initial moment that made 21 Savage a household name. Adventurous, introspective, and thoughtful, it's just what the world needs from the rapper at this moment, even if we didn't know it." Mark Elibert of HipHopDX said, "The Grammy Award winner shows he continues to be ambitious as an artist while keeping up the Slaughter King mantra he ran with early in his career. For Young Metro, Savage Mode II asserts there's no rust on his boards and proves he's still one of the best architects in the game."\n\nReviewing the album for Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre stated "The first Savage Mode didn't become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews said, "The 44 minutes of this album could exist without Mr. Freeman, but they couldn't exist without Metro Boomin. ...  a solid RAPPER through and through and in an era of singers I'm always going to appreciate that, but if I said I could ignore the banality of Savage Mode II lyrically I'd be lying." In a lukewarm review, Exclaim!'s Jacob Carey wrote, "Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While Savage Mode II is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for."\n\nSavage Mode II debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 171,000 album-equivalent units (including 22,000 pure album sales). This became 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one debut. The album also accumulated a total of 200.1 million on-demand streams of the album's songs during that week.	f

It was released on October 2, 2020, and was previewed through a trailer with narration by Morgan Freeman. The album serves as a sequel to the duo's extended play Savage Mode (2016). It features guest appearances by Drake, Young Thug, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. On October 19, 2020, a chopped and screwed version of the album was released.\n\nSavage Mode II received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, becoming 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one album. It was supported by two singles: "Runnin" and "Mr. Right Now".\n\nMetro Boomin first announced the project in July 2019, after 21 Savage brought him out on stage during a concert. Speaking to the crowd, Metro simply stated that Savage Mode II was on the way. On February 18, 2020, the producer tweeted a photo of himself and Savage in the studio. The caption for the picture read "MODE". On March 3, 21 Savage reposted a fan's Instagram story that the project would be released on March 13. In May, Savage stated that they were making sure the album is "perfect" before being released. The project's release was officially announced on September 28, with the duo confirmed the release date and previewing the album with a horror-themed, "macabre" trailer directed by Gibson Hazard, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman; he recorded his contributions onto his iPhone at his home. The visual contains in-studio scenes of the pair, as Freeman informs viewers of the meaning of "savage mode": "'Savage' is defined as 'fierce, beastly and untamed'. 'Mode' is defined as 'a way of operating or using the system'. So to be in 'savage mode' is to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or deter you from your mission. Basically, this means when someone is in 'savage mode', they're not to be fucked with". The announcement came a week after fans launched a petition urging Savage and Metro to release the album. It garnered over 28,000 signatures.\n\nMetro Boomin unveiled the album cover on September 29 on his social media, with the caption: "Boominati Slaughter Gang taking over for the 2020 and the 21", recalling Juvenile's line "Cash Money Records taking over the 99 and the 2000" from his single "Back That Azz Up". The cover was created by Pen & Pixel, who came out of retirement for the design. It is a "nostalgic" and vintage artwork, "heavily" inspired by those of Cash Money and No Limit Records and is a nod to the "bling rap" album covers of the 1990s.\n\nA promotional website for the album was created, featuring a live countdown to the project's release and a phone number that listeners could call to hear snippets of the tracks.\n\nThe music video for the song, "Runnin", was released on October 2, 2020. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2020, as the album's dual lead single, along with "Mr. Right Now", featuring Canadian rapper Drake, which was serviced to urban contemporary radio. The music video for "My Dawg", was released on October 7, 2020.\n\nSavage Mode II was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nIn a positive review, Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that "As a whole, the album is confirmation of two young artists at the top of their game, watching the landscape unfold from the throne they earned themselves four years ago." Robin Murray of Clash praised the "crisp and future-facing" production from Metro Boomin, as well as the rap performances by 21 Savage. He concluded: "Savage Mode 2 matches ruthless entertainment to phenomenal artistry, a collaboration that works on a number of levels."

It was released on November 12, 2021, by Aftermath Entertainment and Atlantic Records.

Silk Sonic recruited American musician Bootsy Collins for narration, and composers such as D'Mile to co-produce the album, which was recorded in 2017 and early 2020 to mid-2021.\n\nThree singles preceded the album: the lead single "Leave the Door Open" was a commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart as Mars's eighth number one song in the United States and Paak's first. The follow-up, "Skate", charted moderately, reaching number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The third single, "Smokin Out the Window", was released on November 5, 2021.	f

It was released on December 7, 2012, by Atlantic Records. Encompassing elements of reggae rock, disco and soul music, the album deviates from the "energetic" sound aimed during earlier recording sessions for Mars' sophomore output. It serves as the follow-up to his debut record Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Mars's writing and production team, the Smeezingtons, composed the whole record and worked with several past collaborators, Jeff Bhasker and Supa Dups, while enlisting new producers, such as Mark Ronson and Emile Haynie, and no guest vocalists.\n\nThe album was initially planned to be more "energetic" than his previous work, but ended up presenting a wide range of styles such as R&B, pop, reggae, rock, disco, funk and soul music. Lyrically, "Unorthodox Jukebox" revolves around the theme of relationships, incorporating more explicit lyrics and subjects than his previous material. Critical response to "Unorthodox Jukebox" was generally favorable; many reviewers compared Mars's work to that of his previous album, while others deemed its lyrics shallow.\n\nIt debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 192,000 copies, and later topped the chart. The record also reached number one in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The album was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), three times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), Music Canada (MC), Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). "Unorthodox Jukebox" was the fourth best-selling album in 2013 and it has since sold six million units globally as of 2016. In 2014, Unorthodox Jukebox won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Grammy Awards and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards.\n\n"Unorthodox Jukebox" was supported by five singles, including two US Billboard Hot 100 number ones "Locked Out of Heaven" and "When I Was Your Man", which also experienced commercial acclaim in various countries, with the former also topping the Canadian Hot 100. Subsequently, three other singles ("Treasure", "Gorilla", and "Young Girls") were made available for consumption in 2013, with each one of them having major to moderate success in the United States. The album was further promoted through The Moonshine Jungle Tour, along with various television appearances.	f

It was released on October 4, 2010, by Atlantic and Elektra Records and was made available to listen before its official release on September 24, 2010. After the release of the EP "It's Better If You Don't Understand", Mars's writing and production team, the Smeezingtons, began working on the album with Needlz, Supa Dups and Jeff Bhasker as producers.\n\n"Doo-Wops & Hooligans" draws on a variety of influences. Lyrically, the album visualizes carefree optimism along with failed relationships, pain and loneliness. "Doo-Wops & Hooligans" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the album's similarity to the work of American artists Michael Jackson and Jason Mraz, although others felt that the album tried too hard to appeal to all groups. About.com's Bill Lamb and Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen called "Doo-Wops & Hooligans" one of the year's best debut albums.\n\n"Doo-Wops & Hooligans" topped the charts in Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified seven-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), nine-times platinum by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and six-times by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). As of 2020, the album has sold over 15 million copies globally. The first two singles, "Just the Way You Are" and "Grenade" were successful internationally, topping the charts in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Subsequent singles "The Lazy Song", which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and Denmark, and "Marry You" reached the top ten in over ten countries. "Talking to the Moon" and "Count On Me" had a limited release.\n\nAt the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011, "Just the Way You Are" received a Grammy Award in the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. Doo-Wops & Hooligans received five nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the single "Grenade". It was promoted primarily through the Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010–2012) and a co-headline tour with Janelle Monáe, called Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011), along with a number of television appearances.\n\nThe album’s title refers to the doo-wop music style, of which Bruno’s music is influenced. Mars later explained in an interview that the “doo-wop” part represents the girls, while the “hooligans” part points out at the guys, and he elaborated on this concept later on:\n\n"I’m a big fan of doo-wop music, my album has a little bit of that influence, with the simplicity of it… You can listen to a thousand doo-wop songs, and it’s the same four chords. But it’s the message behind the song—its straight to the point and it’s beautiful. That’s what you call your girl, your “doo-wop.” I call my girlfriend my “doo-wop”! On this album, I have records that women are going to relate to and men are going to relate to. So, “doo-wops” are for the girls, and “hooligans” are for the guys."	f

Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. After being dropped by Motown Records, Mars signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009. In the same year, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. In 2016, Shampoo Press & Curl replaced The Smeezingtons on the composition of Mars' third studio album, 24K Magic.\n\nMars rose to fame in 2010 with the release of the successful singles "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals on the hooks. His debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010) peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 and reached the top in Canada, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and in the United Kingdom albums charts. It spawned the international number-one singles "Just the Way You Are", "Grenade" and "The Lazy Song". The former won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 2011, Mars recorded the thriving single "It Will Rain" for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1.\n\nMars' second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and in the UK, winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

Ocean also notably makes use of pitch shifted vocals. The Beach Boys' de facto leader Brian Wilson is recognized as a strong influence on the album's lush arrangements and layered vocal harmonies, while the guitar and keyboard rhythms on the album are considered as languid and minimal. The album's themes surrounds Ocean dealing with his masculinity and emotions, inspired by sexual experiences, heartbreak, loss and trauma. The album also features guest vocals from André 3000, Beyoncé, and Kim Burrell, among others.

Its physical release was accompanied by a magazine entitled Boys Don't Cry.\n\nRather than going on a typical promotional tour playing radio festivals and appearing on television shows, Ocean spent a month after the release of Blonde, traveling to countries such as China, Japan and France.

It was released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings.\n\nAfter releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording his debut album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. Other producers to work on the album included Om'Mas Keith and Pharrell Williams. Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator, vocalist/songwriter André 3000, and guitarist John Mayer.\n\nChannel Orange has an unconventional musical style, drawing on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, psychedelic music, and nonmusical sounds such as film dialogue and ambient noise that function as interludes. Vocally, Ocean uses a free-form flow as well as alternating falsetto and tenor registers throughout the album. His songwriting explores themes of unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme–color synesthesia, through which he perceived the color orange during the summer he first fell in love.\n\nTo prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean and Def Jam released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. It was promoted with five singles, including Ocean's highest charting single "Thinkin Bout You" (number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100) and a supporting concert tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week, eventually selling 621,000 copies in the US by September 2014. Critically, it was the best-reviewed album of 2012 and the year's top-ranked album in numerous critics' lists, including the American Pazz & Jop and the British HMV Poll of Polls. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Channel Orange was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Urban Contemporary Album. It has been featured in several lists of the best albums of the 2010s and of all time.	f

Following the collaboration album Reanimation which featured remixes of their debut album Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park released singles from Meteora for over a year, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Faint", "Lying from You", "From the Inside", "Breaking the Habit" and "Numb".\n\nIt is the most successful album in the history of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative rock songs. "Numb" was the biggest song of the year on the chart. The album has sold over 5 million copies in the United States, and over 16 million worldwide to date.\n\nThe album was named after the Meteora rock formation in Greece. After seeing these monasteries on a trip to Europe, the band was inspired by the way they were built, almost defying gravity. It was this feeling of greatness and awesome accomplishment that Linkin Park wished to convey with their music, thus the name.\n\nDon Gilmore co-produced the album. Linkin Park comprehensively rehearsed the album, recording more than 40 choruses for the first single "Somewhere I Belong". Like the band's first full-length Hybrid Theory, Meteora was recorded using multitrack recording methods in which each instrument is recorded individually rather than played all at once, as is done in a typical studio setting. In its first week it sold an estimated 810,000 units. To date, it has well over 4 million copies in the U.S. alone, nearly 16 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe music in Meteora represents significant changes since the release of Hybrid Theory. It is characterized by more relevant influences from rap metal ("Lying from You", "Hit the Floor", "Faint", "Figure.09", "Nobody's Listening"). Their instrumental song "Session" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2003. "Nobody's Listening" featured a small sample from the band's track, "High Voltage", which appeared on the B-side of One Step Closer and the bonus disc of Hybrid Theory. The sample was a distorted version of Mike rapping, "Coming at you from every side" which comes from the chorus of High Voltage.\n\nThe instrumental track "Session" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded and on the Season Five Sopranos episode "In Camelot".	f

Records. The album was a huge commercial success, selling over 10 million units in the United States alone and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 while also reaching high positions on other charts worldwide, despite receiving mixed reviews from publications. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009, including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album, the second best-selling album of the 21st century so far, and the second best selling debut album. It is also one of the few albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. that was released in this century.\n\nRecorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: "One Step Closer", "Papercut", "In the End", and the Grammy Award-winning "Crawling", which along with "In the End" was responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\nHybrid Theory was released in the United States on October 24, 2000 following the debut of "One Step Closer" on the radio. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 charts at #16 in late 2000, and was certified gold by the RIAA five weeks after its release. In 2001, Hybrid Theory sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 for selling 10 million copies in the U.S. In 2007, it has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009, including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album and the best-selling debut album of the 21st century.\n\nCritical opinion for Hybrid Theory was mixed. Some critics gave the album positive reviews; Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory four out of five stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a "two-star honorable mention rating", citing "Papercut" and "Points of Authority" as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone commented that Hybrid Theory had "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" and called it an album that "reflects the frustration of life".\n\nOther critics, however, dismissed the album. Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann said that "Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style" and called "One Step Closer" "a typical effort", referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus. NME's Noel Gardner commented that "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," giving the album a score of six out of ten.\n\nDespite initially mixed reviews, Hybrid Theory found itself in several “must have” lists that were compiled by various music publications, networks, and other media.

In an interview in September 2006, Shinoda explained: "When songs are pouring out you don't ever want to stop that. We already have over 100 roughs for songs. We've narrowed it down since but we're not ready to commit to those yet."\n\nFrom the late stages of the demo sessions, the song "QWERTY", which was rumored to be on Minutes to Midnight, appeared on the Linkin Park Underground v6.0 CD on December 5, 2006 in both live and studio demo versions.\n\n"This was a year-and-a-half long process of really hard work and experimentation in the studio that yielded about 150 rough songs," guitarist Brad Delson told Billboard.com. "Not only is this album incredibly diverse, but the depth of the material is really strong."\n\nThe first single, "What I've Done", was released April 2, 2007, and debuted at number one on the United States Modern Rock chart.\n\n"Given Up", "What I've Done" and "No More Sorrow" made their live debut on April 28, 2007 in Berlin.

I also got remarried so there was a big contrast in my life. For a while I couldn't be completely happy with the new life I was starting and I couldn't end the last one. This is a song about all of that."\n\n2.THE LITTLE THINGS YOU GIVE AWAY\nThis song deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and its effect on the city of New Orleans. The band finished this song after visiting New Orleans after the hurricane hit. (thanks, Bronte - Wrexham, Wales)\n\nThis is one of the few Linkin Park songs with a guitar solo. (thanks, Jake - Albuquerque, NM)\n\nGuitarist Brad Delson in Kerrang! magazine: "This is our favorite song on the record. It's the biggest statement that we've ever made. Nothing could go after it as everything would get eclipsed by it, that's why it's at the end."\n\nSinger Mike Shinoda in the same Kerrang! interview: "Brad has always avoided solos because he doesn't like to show off. But when he played that solo, though, it was one of the most emotional moments we've recorded. It says what the lyrics are saying without any words."\n\n3. BLEED IT OUT\n\nLinkin Park singer Mike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "I wrote the lyrics to this about 100 times. it's always frustrating as a lyricist to come in with a new version that you spent hours on and have the band tell you that it's not there yet. in one case, they listened to my lyrics for 30 seconds and told me to start over again. that was pretty hard. it felt like I was bringing in the lyrics, getting punched in the face and then going back to the drawing board. When it finally came together I said to the band 'I don't think anyone but us could have made a song like this'. It's a f--king bizarre death-party-rap-hoedown!"\n\n4.WHAT I'VE DONE \n\nIn this song, Chester Bennington sings about things we've done that we regret - how we want to forget it all and move on. According to Bennington, the theme of the song is "admitting to your faults of the past and kind of accepting it and moving on and trying to become something better."\n\nThe album title Minutes To Midnight refers to military terms of nuclear warfare, otherwise known as the Doomsday Clock. It is a political statement, but could also indicate the pressure the band was under to finish the album. (thanks, Steven - Anderson, CA, for above 2)\n\nRick Rubin produced this track, and stripped Linkin Park's sound down to give them a more raw feel. Rubin did something similar in his work with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)\n\nMike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "On the other albums, Brad (Delson) and I started every song together (separately). But this was the only song that we wrote together and was the last one we finished. We wanted a song that encapsulated the feel of the whole record and I think this is that song. You're going to get something different out of every time you listen to it."\n\nThis debuted at #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart April 12th 2007. "What I've Done" was the third song in this tally's 19-year existence to begin its chart life at #1. The other two were R.E.M.'s "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" and Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Dani California."\n\nThe album Minutes To Midnight went to #1 in 28 of the countries in which it was released.	f

Shinoda stated in an interview with MTV that the album references numerous social issues, as well as blending human ideas with technology. The album's title comes from the Hindu Sanskrit scripture, the Bhagavad Gita: "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one," a quote made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb, which references the numerous apocalyptic themes of the album.\n\nThe lead single for the album, "The Catalyst", was sent to radio and released to digital music retailers on August 2, 2010.

Also, on May 18, 2007, Linkin Park appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and again performed "What I've Done" and "Bleed It Out".\n\nOn January 16, 2008, "Valentine's Day" finally made its live debut in Hannover, Germany.\nCountry \tRelease Date\nWorldwide \tMay 14, 2007 (2007-05-14)\nCanada \tMay 15, 2007\n\nSONGFACTS\n\n1\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington on In Pieces: "I got divorced recently and that was very difficult. I also got remarried so there was a big contrast in my life. For a while I couldn't be completely happy with the new life I was starting and I couldn't end the last one. This is a song about all of that."\n\n2.THE LITTLE THINGS YOU GIVE AWAY\nThis song deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and its effect on the city of New Orleans. The band finished this song after visiting New Orleans after the hurricane hit. (thanks, Bronte - Wrexham, Wales)\n\nThis is one of the few Linkin Park songs with a guitar solo. (thanks, Jake - Albuquerque, NM)\n\nGuitarist Brad Delson in Kerrang! magazine: "This is our favorite song on the record. It's the biggest statement that we've ever made. Nothing could go after it as everything would get eclipsed by it, that's why it's at the end."\n\nSinger Mike Shinoda in the same Kerrang! interview: "Brad has always avoided solos because he doesn't like to show off. But when he played that solo, though, it was one of the most emotional moments we've recorded. It says what the lyrics are saying without any words."\n\n3. BLEED IT OUT\n\nLinkin Park singer Mike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "I wrote the lyrics to this about 100 times. it's always frustrating as a lyricist to come in with a new version that you spent hours on and have the band tell you that it's not there yet. in one case, they listened to my lyrics for 30 seconds and told me to start over again. that was pretty hard. it felt like I was bringing in the lyrics, getting punched in the face and then going back to the drawing board. When it finally came together I said to the band 'I don't think anyone but us could have made a song like this'. It's a f--king bizarre death-party-rap-hoedown!"\n\n4.WHAT I'VE DONE \n\nIn this song, Chester Bennington sings about things we've done that we regret - how we want to forget it all and move on. According to Bennington, the theme of the song is "admitting to your faults of the past and kind of accepting it and moving on and trying to become something better."\n\nThe album title Minutes To Midnight refers to military terms of nuclear warfare, otherwise known as the Doomsday Clock. It is a political statement, but could also indicate the pressure the band was under to finish the album. (thanks, Steven - Anderson, CA, for above 2)\n\nRick Rubin produced this track, and stripped Linkin Park's sound down to give them a more raw feel. Rubin did something similar in his work with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)\n\nMike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "On the other albums, Brad (Delson) and I started every song together (separately). But this was the only song that we wrote together and was the last one we finished. We wanted a song that encapsulated the feel of the whole record and I think this is that song. You're going to get something different out of every time you listen to it."\n\nThis debuted at #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart April 12th 2007. "What I've Done" was the third song in this tally's 19-year existence to begin its chart life at #1. The other two were R.E.M.'s "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" and Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Dani California."\n\nThe album Minutes To Midnight went to #1 in 28 of the countries in which it was released.	f

Records. The album was a huge commercial success, selling over 10 million units in the United States alone and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 while also reaching high positions on other charts worldwide, despite receiving mixed reviews from publications. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009, including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album, the second best-selling album of the 21st century so far, and the second best selling debut album. It is also one of the few albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. that was released in this century. \n\nRecorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: "One Step Closer", "Papercut", "In the End", and the Grammy Award-winning "Crawling", which along with "In the End" was responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\nHybrid Theory was released in the United States on October 24, 2000 following the debut of "One Step Closer" on the radio. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 charts at #16 in late 2000, and was certified gold by the RIAA five weeks after its release. In 2001, Hybrid Theory sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 for selling 10 million copies in the U.S. In 2007, it has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009, including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album and the best-selling debut album of the 21st century.\n\nCritical opinion for Hybrid Theory was mixed. Some critics gave the album positive reviews; Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory four out of five stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a "two-star honorable mention rating", citing "Papercut" and "Points of Authority" as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone commented that Hybrid Theory had "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" and called it an album that "reflects the frustration of life".\n\nOther critics, however, dismissed the album. Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann said that "Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style" and called "One Step Closer" "a typical effort", referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus. NME's Noel Gardner commented that "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," giving the album a score of six out of ten.\n\n\n\n\nDespite initially mixed reviews, Hybrid Theory found itself in several “must have” lists that were compiled by various music publications, networks, and other media.

The album, self-produced by band members Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson, was released by Warner Bros. The album is the first since Meteora not to be produced with Rick Rubin, after producing the band's previous three studio albums.\n\nThe Hunting Party is a departure from the band's recent electronic rock sound of their previous two studio albums. The album, described by Mike Shinoda as simply "a rock record", serves a statement by the band against contemporary mainstream and active rock bands, accused by Shinoda as "trying to be other bands and playing it safe". Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based off an original drawing by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written in the studio by members of the band. The album also features guest appearances from Page Hamilton of Helmet, Rakim, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine. These are the band's first featured musicians on a studio album.	f

Recorded during the Hybrid Theory tour in 2001, it features remixes of songs from Hybrid Theory, including the album's bonus tracks. The remix album was produced by Mike Shinoda and mixed by Mark "Spike" Stent. The album to date is the fourth best selling remix album of all time, behind Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix by Michael Jackson, You Can Dance by Madonna and Love by The Beatles.\n\n"Pts.OF.Athrty", the remix of "Points of Authority" by Jay Gordon of Orgy, was released as the first and only official single from Reanimation. The single also features b-sides "H! Vltg3", the remix of "High Voltage" by Evidence and DJ Babu featuring additional vocals by Pharoahe Monch, as well as a remix of "By Myself", entitled "Buy Myself", by American musician Marilyn Manson.\n\n"Enth E Nd", "Frgt/10", "Songs from Reanimation" and "My Dsmbr" were released as radio promotional singles.\n\nThe official video for "Pts.OF.Athrty" depicts a completely CGI-animated battle between robots, ruled by the heads of Linkin Park members, and an alien race.\n\nMTV 2 made videos for each song of the album for its playback of the album on "MTV:Playback" which aired only a few times. These include "Frgt/10" (a girl doing graffiti in a town while evading the police chopper) "Opening" (the girl from the video for "Frgt/10" going to bed), "Pts.OF.Athrty" (the US flag up to 1:05, then a motorcycle chase), "" (the girl in bed and shots of her room), "P5hng Me A*wy" (a cannibal at work), "Plc. 4 Mie Hæd" (the girl singing to the song), "X-Ecutioner Style" (a cartoon boy walking around town, singing Chester's "Shut Up" parts), "H! Vltg3" (a night in the life of a man), "" (the girl in bed), "Wth>You" (very quick montage of Mugshots of people in sync with the song), "Ppr:Kut" (shots of people's reactions to an unexpected loud noise while listening to music; Joe Hahn made a cameo appearance in this video), "Rnw@y" (a woman with a Mohawk in town, running in each chorus of the song), My Dsmbr (a man obviously lives on the beach and does some amusements in an amusement park), "By_Myslf" (a woman in a forest), "Kyur4 th Ich" (people breakdancing, Joe Hahn made another appearance as his cameo), "1Stp Klosr" (depicts a failing relationship) and "Krwlng" (animation of a white stick man). The only song that does not receive an animated video was "Enth E ND"; the video shows Mike Shinoda, KutMasta Kurt and Motion Man performing their respective parts and verses in the back of a car. This was the only video to show the actual performers of the song.\n\nOnly the MTV 2 videos of "Frgt/10" and "Kyur4 th Ich" were officially released on the DVD-A edition of the album, along with the official "Pts.OF.Athrty" video. The videos of "Pts.OF.Athrty", "Frgt/10", "Kyur4 th Ich" and "Enth E ND" were the only videos considered "official".\n\nReanimation's standard edition came in a digipak case with 20 tracks. The Japanese edition included "Buy Myself" as a bonus track. The iTunes release, in addition to "Buy Myself", also included live recordings of "One Step Closer" and "My December", originally released as b-sides for "Faint" and "Somewhere I Belong" respectively.\n\nAlso released was a DVD-A version with surround sound and music videos for "Pts.Of.Athrty", "Frgt/10", and "Kyur4 Th Ich". Linkin Park Underground 1.0 members received the DVD-A edition for free as a Christmas gift.\n\nA test release of a DualDisc version was sold in Boston and Seattle only. This edition contained the album on one side of the disc and special content on the other. It never progressed beyond the test run and thus the DualDisc edition is difficult to obtain.\n\nThe entire album was later re-released in 2020 on CD and vinyl as part of the 20th Anniversary Edition of Hybrid Theory, with "Buy Myself" also released as part of the boxset's B-Side Rarities collection.\n\nSome of the material on Reanimation found its way into Linkin Park's live shows, as attested by the presence on Live in Texas of "P5hng Me A*wy", which had been played during the band's touring from the summer 2003 through the winter of 2004. The bridge from "1Stp Klosr" and the instrumental portion of "Wth>You" have been played during performances of "One Step Closer" and "With You" from 2003 to 2006. For some shows, Jonathan Davis of Korn went on stage to perform the bridge of "1Stp Klosr" while the band performed the original "One Step Closer". "Pts.OF.Athrty" was used as an intro to "Points of Authority" for Linkin Park's summer touring in 2004. "Frgt/10" was played once in 2005, during a Music for Relief benefit show with Chali 2na, where Jurassic 5 was also present. In addition, the intro to "Krwlng" has often served as the intro to "Crawling" during live performances in 2004, while a shortened version was used in 2003 and as the intro of the band's Live 8 set. In winter 2008, the "Krwlng" intro made its return to the show. Starting at Projekt Revolution 2008, Shinoda started incorporating the first verse of "Hands Held High" over the instrumental, which started after the verse was performed a cappella at a show on June 29, 2008 at the National Bowl in England, which can be seen on the band's second live album, Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes. "Hands Held High" would remain over the "Krwlng" intro through 2009. Occasionally, the first verse would be performed a capella with the second verse performed over the instrumental. "Enth E Nd" was played live but not under Linkin Park, it was played under Fort Minor (Mike Shinoda's side project). Chester Bennington came out and sang his part on the song. This was the first time a song from Linkin Park was debuted under another band, but it was played with two of Linkin Park band members (Shinoda and Bennington). In Mike Shinoda's year-long Post Traumatic Tour throughout 2018-2019, Mike rapped the first verse of "Enth E Nd" over the second verse of the stripped down version of "In The End" during the tour's final stop in Manila.\n\nReanimation was met with mixed reviews from critics. It helped the many underground hip hop artists that it featured reach a larger audience, as well as changing the nature of the work so significantly (restructuring songs, adding or substantially changing verses, and adding several guest artists) that it could be considered an entirely new album. The album received an average score of 60 from Metacritic. Reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album "a welcome step in the right direction," and he praised Reanimation for attempting to break new ground. Linkin Park have also stated that this album could be considered both a remix and studio album. The album reached a peak position of #2 on the Billboard 200 and stayed on the list for 33 straight weeks. It sold 270,000 copies in its debut week., and nearly two millions overall. It became the fourth best-selling remix album of all time.\n\nAt the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, British ice dancers Sinead and John Kerr skated to "Krwlng".\n\nIn 2011, magician Dynamo walked across the Thames River. This was shown during his TV show Dynamo: Magician Impossible while the song "Krwlng" played over it.\n\nThe videos for "Pts.OF.Athrty", "Frgt/10" and "Kyur4 Th Ich" are the only videos of Reanimation to be available for purchase on iTunes.\n\nThe DVD-Audio version contains the complete album mixed in 5.1 surround sound, along with the music videos for "Pts.OF.Athrty", "Frgt/10", and "Kyur4 th Ich", as well as the making of "Pts.OF.Athrty" feature. This is only available in a DVD-Audio format. It plays in most DVD players and DVD-A compatible DVD players. This version was originally distributed to members of the Linkin Park Underground, who signed up before November 10, 2002, for free. It was also made into a DualDisc format which contained the CD version on one side and the DVD-Audio on the other.\n\nThe DualDisc version was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc has the standard album on one side, and the DVD-Audio track listing on the second side. The DualDisc version was not reissued after the test market run.\n\nThere are currently four known demos from the Reanimation recording sessions – one for "1stp Klosr", only remixed by the Humble Brothers without Jonathan Davis (this was a hidden feature on the DVD Frat Party at the Pankake Festival), a demo of "Pts.OF.Athrty" remixed by Jay Gordon, an original demo version of the "Plc.4 Mie Hæd" remix by Amp Live and a "Frgt/10" demo that surfaced on a fansite called LPLive over 10 years after the release of Reanimation, featuring a different mix as well as lyrics. These have not been commercially released, but they have become popular online and amongst Linkin Park fans.\n\nRemixes were also crafted by Tricky, Prince Paul, DJ Z-Trip, and Team Sleep ("My December").\n\nTracks 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 16 are not on Hybrid Theory. Tracks 9 and 15 are remixes of Hybrid Theory B-sides, while the rest were created specifically for Reanimation.	f

It never progressed beyond the test run and thus the DualDisc edition is difficult to obtain.\n\nThe entire album was later re-released in 2020 on CD and vinyl as part of the 20th Anniversary Edition of Hybrid Theory, with "Buy Myself" also released as part of the boxset's B-Side Rarities collection.\n\nSome of the material on Reanimation found its way into Linkin Park's live shows, as attested by the presence on Live in Texas of "P5hng Me A*wy", which had been played during the band's touring from the summer 2003 through the winter of 2004. The bridge from "1Stp Klosr" and the instrumental portion of "Wth>You" have been played during performances of "One Step Closer" and "With You" from 2003 to 2006. For some shows, Jonathan Davis of Korn went on stage to perform the bridge of "1Stp Klosr" while the band performed the original "One Step Closer". "Pts.OF.Athrty" was used as an intro to "Points of Authority" for Linkin Park's summer touring in 2004. "Frgt/10" was played once in 2005, during a Music for Relief benefit show with Chali 2na, where Jurassic 5 was also present. In addition, the intro to "Krwlng" has often served as the intro to "Crawling" during live performances in 2004, while a shortened version was used in 2003 and as the intro of the band's Live 8 set. In winter 2008, the "Krwlng" intro made its return to the show. Starting at Projekt Revolution 2008, Shinoda started incorporating the first verse of "Hands Held High" over the instrumental, which started after the verse was performed a cappella at a show on June 29, 2008 at the National Bowl in England, which can be seen on the band's second live album, Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes. "Hands Held High" would remain over the "Krwlng" intro through 2009. Occasionally, the first verse would be performed a capella with the second verse performed over the instrumental. "Enth E Nd" was played live but not under Linkin Park, it was played under Fort Minor (Mike Shinoda's side project). Chester Bennington came out and sang his part on the song. This was the first time a song from Linkin Park was debuted under another band, but it was played with two of Linkin Park band members (Shinoda and Bennington). In Mike Shinoda's year-long Post Traumatic Tour throughout 2018-2019, Mike rapped the first verse of "Enth E Nd" over the second verse of the stripped down version of "In The End" during the tour's final stop in Manila.\n\nReanimation was met with mixed reviews from critics. It helped the many underground hip hop artists that it featured reach a larger audience, as well as changing the nature of the work so significantly (restructuring songs, adding or substantially changing verses, and adding several guest artists) that it could be considered an entirely new album. The album received an average score of 60 from Metacritic. Reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album "a welcome step in the right direction," and he praised Reanimation for attempting to break new ground. Linkin Park have also stated that this album could be considered both a remix and studio album. The album reached a peak position of #2 on the Billboard 200 and stayed on the list for 33 straight weeks. It sold 270,000 copies in its debut week., and nearly two millions overall. It became the fourth best-selling remix album of all time.\n\nAt the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, British ice dancers Sinead and John Kerr skated to "Krwlng".\n\nIn 2011, magician Dynamo walked across the Thames River. This was shown during his TV show Dynamo: Magician Impossible while the song "Krwlng" played over it.\n\nThe videos for "Pts.OF.Athrty", "Frgt/10" and "Kyur4 Th Ich" are the only videos of Reanimation to be available for purchase on iTunes.\n\nThe DVD-Audio version contains the complete album mixed in 5.1 surround sound, along with the music videos for "Pts.OF.Athrty", "Frgt/10", and "Kyur4 th Ich", as well as the making of "Pts.OF.Athrty" feature. This is only available in a DVD-Audio format. It plays in most DVD players and DVD-A compatible DVD players. This version was originally distributed to members of the Linkin Park Underground, who signed up before November 10, 2002, for free. It was also made into a DualDisc format which contained the CD version on one side and the DVD-Audio on the other.\n\nThe DualDisc version was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc has the standard album on one side, and the DVD-Audio track listing on the second side. The DualDisc version was not reissued after the test market run.\n\nThere are currently four known demos from the Reanimation recording sessions – one for "1stp Klosr", only remixed by the Humble Brothers without Jonathan Davis (this was a hidden feature on the DVD Frat Party at the Pankake Festival), a demo of "Pts.OF.Athrty" remixed by Jay Gordon, an original demo version of the "Plc.4 Mie Hæd" remix by Amp Live and a "Frgt/10" demo that surfaced on a fansite called LPLive over 10 years after the release of Reanimation, featuring a different mix as well as lyrics. These have not been commercially released, but they have become popular online and amongst Linkin Park fans.\n\nRemixes were also crafted by Tricky, Prince Paul, DJ Z-Trip, and Team Sleep ("My December").\n\nTracks 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 16 are not on Hybrid Theory. Tracks 9 and 15 are remixes of Hybrid Theory B-sides, while the rest were created specifically for Reanimation.	f

Approximately six months later, Del Rey released her debut album, Born to Die, which is filled with torch songs influenced by hip-hop. She wrote and recorded the tracks in a chilling fashion befitting the self-proclaimed “gangster Nancy Sinatra.” The album’s first six songs alone are enough to warrant a spot in modern music collections alongside ADELE, Amy Winehouse, and Erykah Badu. There’s no denying these noir-shaded numbers—many of which are built on orchestral accouterments and subtle vocal samples reminiscent of Kanye West productions. Del Rey’s husky narrative lingers like smoke clouds, leaving wafts of rhythmic phrasings delivered by an icy, heartbroken femme fatale. The album’s deluxe version includes three more cuts and a bonus remix of “Video Games”, the song that lit the fuse.	f

While the project was not directly supported by singles of its own, the tracks "Ride" and "Burning Desire" were released from Paradise on September 25, 2012, and March 13, 2013, while "Dark Paradise" was serviced from Born to Die on March 1, 2013. A remix of the track "Summertime Sadness" from Born to Die, produced by Cedric Gervais, was released independently from either project on July 11, 2013; it was later included on select reissues of The Paradise Edition after experiencing success on record charts worldwide.	f

The group broke up after this album was released.\n\nPreviously, bandleader John Fogerty sang all the lead vocals and he wrote almost all the band's original material. His older brother Tom Fogerty had just left after a dispute which was in large part caused by the elder Fogerty's desire to play a larger creative role.\n\nFor this album, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford shared the writing, singing, and production duties. Fogerty only contributed three original songs, and he sang a fourth lead on a cover of the early 1960s standard "Hello Mary Lou." Clifford and Cook each wrote and sang the lead vocals on three songs. The album was a commercial success peaking at #12 and going gold. However, it was considered weak compared to the sales of their previous albums. The album contained two Top 40 singles, both of which were contributed by Fogerty: the raucous "Sweet Hitch-Hiker" and the wistful swan song "Someday Never Comes."\n\nAccording to Stu Cook and Doug Clifford it was John's idea for all the members to contribute songs for the album, even though the two did not want to.	f

This places it after the original band's breakup.  Indeed, the recordings found here are from one of CCR's final tours, and documents the band as a trio (Tom Fogerty having already quit).  \n\nUntil relatively recently, this was thought of by most fans and critics as a lesser release.  It was rather short (under an hour) for a double album, and the missing Fogerty irked purists.  It wasn't until 1998 that a Japanese remastering effort revealed that part of the perceived problems was in the sound quality, and not the performance.  \n\nThe performance itself is mainly a greatest hits run-through.  Several familiar classics are here, such as "Proud Mary" and "Green River", but these are supplemented by a few lesser-known tracks like "It Came From The Sky" and "Door to Door".	f

A 40th Anniversary Edition CD with 3 bonus tracks was released in 2008. "Willy and the Poorboys" was the third CCR record to go platinum and went on to multi-platinum status.

The album spent nine consecutive weeks in the number one position on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1990. In 2003, the album was ranked number 265 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it was re-ranked number 413 on the revised 2020 list.\n\nThe name of the album comes from the warehouse in Berkeley where the band rehearsed. Bandleader John Fogerty was so insistent on practicing (nearly every day) that drummer Doug "Cosmo" Clifford began referring to the place as "the factory".	f

The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Although "Let It Be" was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, most of the album had been recorded before the "Abbey Road" sessions began. A two-sided hit single from the album, "Something" backed with "Come Together", released in October, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US.\n\nAbbey Road is a rock album that incorporates genres such as blues, pop, and progressive rock, and it makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the "Get Back/Let It Be" sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band. John Lennon had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year.\n\nAbbey Road is widely regarded as one of The Beatles' most tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely operating as a functioning unit at the time. Despite the tensions within the band, Abbey Road was released to near universal acclaim and is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2012, Abbey Road was voted 14th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album.\n\nAlthough Abbey Road was an immediate commercial success and reached  No. 1 in the UK and US, it initially received mixed reviews, some critics describing its music as inauthentic and bemoaning the production's artificial effects. Over time, the album became viewed as among the Beatles' best and many critics have ranked it as one of the greatest albums of all time. In particular, George Harrison's contributions, "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", are considered to be among the best songs he wrote for the group. The album's cover, which features the four band members walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, has become one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of popular music.	f

Produced by George Martin, it was released on EMI's Parlophone label on 22 March 1963 in the United Kingdom, following the success of the band's first two singles "Love Me Do", which reached number 17 on the Record Retailer Chart, and "Please Please Me", which reached number one on the NME and Melody Maker charts. The album topped Record Retailer's LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that time. First conceived as a live album by Martin in November 1962, the recording was moved to the studio but intended to capture the sound and repertoire of the Beatles' live performances in places like the Liverpool Cavern Club. Aside from their already released singles, the Beatles recorded the majority of Please Please Me in one long recording session at EMI Studios on 11 February 1963, with Martin adding overdubs to "Misery" and "Baby It's You" nine days later. Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by the songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney (originally credited "McCartney–Lennon"). Rolling Stone magazine later cited these original compositions as early evidence of the Beatles' " the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments". Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" (2012), and number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).	f

The American version of the album was released two weeks earlier, on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records, with a different track listing. It was eventually replaced by the original United Kingdom version with its first release on CD and LP re-release in 1987.\n \nWhile showcasing the development of the band's songwriting talents, the album sticks to the basic rock and roll instrumentation and song format. The album contains some of their most famous songs, including the title track, with its distinct, instantly recognisable opening chord,and the previously released "Can't Buy Me Love"; both were transatlantic number-one singles for the band.\n \nThe title of the album was the accidental creation of drummer Ringo Starr.According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with Playboy magazine: "I was going home in the car and Dick Lester  suggested the title, 'Hard Day's Night' from something Ringo had said. I had used it in 'In His Own Write', but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'"	f

It was released on 6 August 1965. Seven of the fourteen songs, including the singles "Help!" and "Ticket to Ride", appeared in the film and take up the first side of the vinyl album. The second side includes "Yesterday", the most-covered song ever written. The album was met with favorable critical reviews and topped the Australian, German, UK and US charts. During the recording sessions for the album, the Beatles continued to explore the studio's multitracking capabilities to layer their sound. "Yesterday" features a string quartet, the band's first use of Baroque sensibilities, and "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" includes a flute section. The North American release is a true soundtrack album, combining the first seven songs with instrumental music from the film. The omitted tracks are instead spread across the Capitol Records LPs Beatles VI, Rubber Soul and Yesterday and Today. In the US, "Help!" marked the start of artistic recognition for the Beatles from mainstream critics, including comparisons to the European art music tradition. It was nominated in the category of Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammys Awards, marking the first time that a rock band had been recognized in this category. In 2000, it was voted 119th in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2020, it was ranked 266th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In September 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed its sales award rules, Help! was certified platinum for recorded sales since 1994.	f

The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and the United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. 1 was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.\n\nIn addition, 1 is the fourth best-selling album in the US since Nielsen Sound Scan began tracking US album sales in January 1991 and the best-selling album of the decade (2000 to 2009) in the US, as well as the best-selling album of the decade worldwide. 1 was remastered and reissued in September 2011 and was remixed and reissued again in several different deluxe editions in November 2015, the most comprehensive of which is a three-disc set entitled 1+, which includes video discs of the band's music videos.\n\nAs of June 2015, 1 is the sixth best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK, having sold over 3.1 million copies.\n\nBackground:\nCompiled by producer George Martin and the (then) three surviving members of the band, 1 includes the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the Record Retailer Top 50 chart or in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is worth noting, however, that the song "For You Blue" was listed on Billboard chart at number 1, along with the A-side "The Long and Winding Road", but Capitol Records treated "For You Blue" as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. Meanwhile, "Day Tripper" was included on 1, since it charted at number 1 in the UK as a double A-side with "We Can Work It Out," while in the US, only "We Can Work It Out" was number 1. Two notable singles released in both the UK and the US that did not reach number 1 in either country, and were therefore ineligible for inclusion on the album, were "Please Please Me" and "Strawberry Fields Forever" (both reached number 2 in the UK charts, while in the US the former peaked at number 3, and the latter at number 8). The former was largely known as "The Beatles' first UK number one single"; however, it reached the top spot in the musical magazines New Musical Express and Melody Maker but not on the chart published by Record Retailer (now Music Week). On the other hand, "Strawberry Fields Forever" was part of a double A-side single along with "Penny Lane." This single had peaked at number 2 in the charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck's single "Release Me."\n\nThis album is essentially a combination of both the US and UK versions of the earlier album 20 Greatest Hits, with the addition of "Something" (which was left off 20 Greatest Hits because of time constraints). On 1, "Hey Jude" was released in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes); on the American version of 20 Greatest Hits it had been released as a shortened version.\n\nRemastering:\nBefore 1, all 27 songs were available mainly in two remastered CD versions. First, on the respective Beatles albums released in 1987 (as well as Past Masters, Volume One and Past Masters, Volume Two, released in 1988). The second remastering was made available on the CD versions for 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 (released in 1993).\n\nThe songs on 1 were remastered specifically for the release in 2000. According to the liner notes of the album, the original analog masters were "digitally remastered at 24 bits resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16 bit using Prism SNS Noise Shaping." The remastering was overseen by Peter Mew of Abbey Road Studios and took place there. In 2011, 1 was remastered and reissued on CD. In 2015 it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin when Martin began to assist with fixing up the audio tracks for the 1+ video clips, he realized that his goal of making them “more immersive” should also apply to 1. For the remixing project, the remasters went back to the final mix tapes, remastered them, cleaned them up and then EQ-ed them and released them. About the remastering, Martin commented: "My approach was to be respectful of everything, I had sessions and sessions where I flipped between previously remastered stereos, the mono remasters, and the remixes we’ve done. I flip between everything and make sure I prefer what we’ve done."\n\nPackage:\nThe package of 1 was intended to be simplistic and ambitious at the same time. Its cover was designed by Rick Ward and consists of a pop-art yellow number one on a red background. The emphasis on the 1 digit was used on many of the compilations of number-one hits by different artists that followed this album; for example, ELV1S by Elvis Presley or Number Ones by the Bee Gees. The album's back cover features the famous photos of the Beatles taken by Richard Avedon and copyrighted on 17 August 1967. The design exclusively uses variations of the Helvetica typeface.\n\n1 was released worldwide in CD and cassette. The vinyl format was released in only the United Kingdom. The CD includes a 32-page booklet with a colored page with international picture covers (a total of 163 covers are displayed on the whole booklet) and details (recording date, location, release date, chart stats) for each of the singles. It also includes on its first two pages a collage with 27 1s in different colours (all of them following the same art as the cover) with the sentence "27 No. 1 singles = 1" (which was used as a catch phrase for the promo ads for the album), and a foreword by George Martin.\n\nThe LP and cassette keep the main part of the CD version, but in a different form. The double vinyl record version was not released in the US, but the imported British edition was available. The vinyl version features a large full-color fold-out poster showing 126 picture sleeves (37 fewer than on the CD), and reproductions of the four Richard Avedon photos. The Avedon portraits also appear on the inside of the gatefold cover. The records have custom labels featuring the same graphics as the front cover and are packaged in custom inner sleeves. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, with its four portraits and poster, is reminiscent to that of their titular 1968 album. The cassette included a 20-page insert, including the college, the George Martin commentary and paged Avedon's portraits on its inlay and the whole description for the tracks as a total of 36 covers on its inlay reverse.\n\nRelease variations\n2000 CD.

Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin, except the first three tracks, which are the original mono mixes. In addition to the new mixes, there are surround sound 5.1 mixes presented as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio in the Blu-ray version and Dolby Digital and DTS in the DVD version.\n\n1+ also includes 50 promotional films/performances, plus commentary and introductions from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. All the videos have been digitally restored and enhanced. They are available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nVariations of 1/1+ include standard CD, CD/DVD, CD/Blu-ray, CD/2DVD, CD/2Blu-ray. The double-disc video editions also feature a 124-page hard-bound book with illustrations. The DVD/Blu-ray video editions are also available as a stand-alone package.\n\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource    Rating\nAllMusic    5/5 stars\nNME    9/10\nQ    4/5 stars\nMelody Maker    5/5 stars\n1 received universal acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five. He stated that there is "no question that this is all great music," although to him "there's really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too."\n\nLegacy:\n1 would go on to inspire the release of a wave of compilation albums, in particular, three other "number ones" albums – Elvis Presley's ELV1S (2002), Michael Jackson's Number Ones (2003) and the Bee Gees' ELV1SNumber Ones (2004). Other compilations issued in its wake included Pink Floyd's 2-CD retrospective Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, Nirvana's Nirvana (2002), The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks (2002), The Who's The Ultimate Collection (2002), and Dean Martin's Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (2004).\n\nSales and chart performance:\nThe reception of 1 surpassed all critical and commercial expectations. It reached number 1 in over 35 countries, achieving the record for the album debuting at the top of the national charts ever. It became the highest-selling of 2000 and, sometime later, of the entire decade. This achievement made the Beatles the first and only artist to have the best-selling albums of two different decades. They also had the best-selling album of the 1960s, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. No tracks from Sgt. Pepper appear on this album. With this album, the Beatles also achieved having an album hit the number 1 position in the US in four non-consecutive decades (the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1 became the Beatles' 15th number 1 album with sales of 319,126 copies (achieving record sales for only one week in 2000). On 18 December 2000, Ananova.com reported that the album has "become 2000's biggest-selling album—in only five weeks." 1 was the first album to stay at the top spot for nine weeks in almost ten years (the last being the Eurythmics's Greatest Hits), the best-selling album of 2000, and the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s so far in the UK. In its eleventh week, 1 sold a total of two million copies in the UK. It spent a total of 46 weeks inside the Top 75. In July 2013 it was certified 10× platinum by the BPI, for over 3 million copies sold in the UK. It is the 21st best-selling album in the UK—according to an assessment by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry that counted album sales in the UK from 28 July 1956 to the present day—, and the second best-selling Beatles album in that country (only beaten by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which is the UK's third best-selling album). As of July 2016, the album has sold over 3,230,000 copies in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, the response was similar. 1 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 during the week of December 2, 2000, with sales totaling over 595,500 copies. In its second week, sales increased to 662,000 but Backstreet Boys' Black & Blue, which sold 1.59 million units, knocked it off the top spot, therefore, 1 fell off to number two on its week on the chart. The following week it stayed at number two selling 607,000 units, by doing so, the album became the sixth to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 and post a SoundScan increase in its second week and the first to do so after opening with a sum of more than half a million copies. During the week of December 23, 2000, its fourth week on the chart, 1 moved 671,000 copies and returned to the top of the Billboard 200. The next week, on December 30, 2000, it stayed at the top of the chart selling 823,500 copies. On February 10, 2001, after being the number one album for eight nonconsecutive weeks, 1 fell off to number four on the Billboard 200 with 173,500 units sold, a 19.5% dip in sales, by the time this happened the album had sold almost six million units. The album spent a total of eight weeks at number 1 and sold 1,258,667 copies during the week before Christmas of 2000. With this number, the Beatles achieved a new record: it was the seventh highest one-week sales in Soundscan history, the highest for an album not in its first week of sales, and the highest for an album comprising previously released music. The album spent 309 weeks inside the Billboard 200 and was the sixth best-selling album in the United States in 2000 with 5,100,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan. On August 30, 2011, the band announced through their Facebook account that the album was available to pre-order from iTunes and that it was digitally remastered. On September 24, 2011, after the album made its digital debut in the iTunes Store it re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number four selling 60,000 units, it also topped the iTunes album charts in the US, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, New Zealand, and Greece according to a Capitol/EMI press release. Its digital launch on the iTunes Store was accompanied by a price of $9.99 and a Twitter camping with the hashtag #MyBeatles1 asking their fans: What is your favorite "1" track? Resulting in many celebrities and stars posting their favorites, too. In 2015, after it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin, 1 re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number six selling 40,000 units. It was certified eleven times platinum by the RIAA on March 8, 2010, denoting shipments of eleven million units, and 1 is included on the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is the best-selling album of the 21st century in the US and the fourth best-selling album in the Soundscan era (1991–present). As of February 2014, the album has had sold 12,410,000 copies in the US. In the US, the album secured the Beatles a fourth decade in which they placed an album at number 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn Canada, 1 debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 54,668 copies in its first week. The album was certified Diamond (1,000,000 units) by the CRIA in February 2001, just four months after its release. As of 2009, 1 has sold 1,103,000 units in Canada, making it the fifth best-selling album ever in Canada of the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nIn Germany, 1 debuted at number 1 and managed to stay there nine non-consecutive weeks. Though this, it stayed only seventeen weeks in the top ten of the German Albums Chart, fifty weeks in the total chart. By selling 1,650,000 copies and reaching 11× Gold, it's the third best-selling album of the decade 2000–2009 and the best-selling non-German language album.\n\nIn 2009, Apple Corps, the Beatles' company, stated that worldwide sales of 1 had exceeded 31 million copies. Worldwide in 2000 the album sold 13.8 million copies, with 2 million or more copies sold during 2 consecutive weeks, and was the fourth best-selling album behind Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP, Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again, and Santana's Supernatural.\n\nTracklisting:\nLennon–McCartney wrote all songs, except "Something" by George Harrison, and those others as noted on the second DVD.

It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterized the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the band's exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. "Beatles for Sale" was not widely available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' catalogue was standardized for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' concurrent release, Beatles '65, issued in North America only. The sessions for "Beatles for Sale" also produced a non-album single, "I Feel Fine" backed by "She's a Woman". During the sessions, the band ventured into studio experimentation, such as employing a fade-in and incorporating guitar feedback, and supplemented the basic recordings with percussion instruments such as timpani, African hand drums and chocalho. The album reflects the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964. Partly as a result of the group's hectic schedule, only eight of the tracks are original compositions, with cover versions of songs by artists such as Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Little Richard being used to complete the album. The original songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics, with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in "I'm a Loser" and "No Reply". Beatles for Sale received favourable reviews in the UK musical press, where it held the number one spot for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20. The album was similarly successful in Australia, where the band's cover of Berry's "Rock and Roll Music" also topped the singles chart. One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, "Eight Days a Week", became the Beatles' seventh number one in the US when issued as a single there in February 1965. In 2000, it was voted number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums.	f

It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom, on EMI's Parlophone label, accompanied by the non-album double A-side single "Day Tripper" / "We Can Work It Out".\n\nThe songs demonstrate the Beatles' increasing maturity as lyricists and, in their incorporation of brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as sitar, harmonium and fuzz bass, the group striving for more expressive sounds and arrangements for their music.\n\nRubber Soul was highly influential on the Beatles' peers, leading to a widespread focus away from singles and onto creating albums of consistently high-quality songs. It has been recognised by music critics as an album that opened up the possibilities of pop music in terms of lyrical and musical scope, and as a key work in the creation of styles such as psychedelia and progressive rock.	f

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. Critics lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. At the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. For this project, they continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP. The album was then loosely conceptualized as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. A key work of British psychedelia, Sgt. Pepper is considered one of the first art rock LPs and a progenitor to progressive rock. It incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. With assistance from producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, much of the recordings were colored with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" and "A Day in the Life". Recording was completed on 21 April. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth. Sgt. Pepper's release was a defining moment in pop culture, heralding the album era and the 1967 Summer of Love, while its reception achieved full cultural legitimization for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. The first Beatles album to be released with the same track listing in both the UK and the US, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honor; in 2003, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. It has topped several critics' and listeners' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All Time Top 1000 Albums, and the UK's "Music of the Millennium" poll. More than 32 million copies had been sold worldwide as of 2011. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and was still, in 2018, the UK's best-selling studio album. A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2017.	f

Named after the location of EMI Studios in London, the cover features the group walking across the street's zebra crossing, an image that became one of the most famous and imitated in popular music. The album's initially mixed reviews were contrasted by its immediate commercial success, topping record charts in the UK and US. The lead single "Something" / "Come Together" was released in October and topped US charts.\n\nThe album incorporates genres such as blues, rock and pop, and makes prominent use of Moog synthesizer, sounds filtered through a Leslie speaker, and tom-tom drums. It is the Beatles' only album recorded exclusively through a solid-state transistor mixing desk, which afforded a clearer and brighter sound than the group's previous records. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The sessions also produced a non-album single, "The Ballad of John and Yoko" backed with "Old Brown Shoe".\n\nProducer George Martin returned on the condition that the Beatles adhere to the discipline of their earlier records. They found the album's recording more enjoyable than the preceding Get Back sessions, but personal issues still permeated the band. Production lasted from February to August 1969, and the closing track "The End" marked the final occasion that all four members recorded together. John Lennon privately left the group six days before the album's release; Paul McCartney publicly declared the band's break-up the following April.\n\nUpon release, detractors found Abbey Road to be inauthentic and bemoaned the production's artificial effects. Since then, many critics have hailed the album as he Beatles' finest; in particular, "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun" are considered among the best songs George Harrison wrote for the group. The album has also been ranked as one of the Beatles' best-selling, including a multi-platinum certification by the RIAA. Shortly after its release, the cover was scrutinised in connection with widespread rumours of McCartney's purported death. EMI Studios was also renamed Abbey Road Studios in honour of the album.	f

Dubbed "the last Beatles song", it is also to be included on the expanded re-issue of the 1973 compilation 1967–1970 It Released On November 2, 2023.\nThe song was originally written and recorded by John Lennon around 1977 as a solo piano home demo, but was left unfinished. After Lennon's death in 1980, the song was considered as the third Beatles reunion single for their 1995–1996 retrospective project The Beatles Anthology, following "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love", both based on Lennon's demos. Instead of being included on Anthology 3, the song was shelved for nearly three decades. It was later completed by surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr with overdubs, as well as guitar tracks by George Harrison from the abandoned 1995 sessions. The finalised version also features additional lyrics by McCartney, and Lennon's voice "extricated" from the original demo using the AI-backed audio restoration technology commissioned by Peter Jackson for his 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back. Jackson also directed the music video for "Now and Then". Lennon wrote "Now and Then" in the late 1970s. He recorded the unfinished piece of music sometime in 1977 as a demo at his home at The Dakota in New York City. The lyrics are typical of the apologetic love songs that Lennon wrote in the latter half of his career. For the most part the verses are nearly complete, though there are still a few lines that Lennon did not flesh out on the demo tape performance. In January 1994, Paul McCartney was given two tape cassettes by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono which included home recordings of songs Lennon never completed or released commercially. The songs on one of the tapes included the eventually completed and released "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love". The two other songs on the other tape were "Grow Old with Me" and "Now and Then", included on a cassette tape which Ono had mentioned to George Harrison and gave to McCartney in 1994, the year Lennon was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. "Grow Old with Me" had already been released in 1984 on the posthumous album Milk and Honey, so the Beatles turned their attention to "Now and Then". In March 1995, the three surviving Beatles began to work on "Now and Then" by recording a rough backing track that was to be used as an overdub. However, after only two days of recording, all work on the song ceased and plans for a third reunion single were scrapped. Producer Jeff Lynne reported that sessions for "Now and Then" consisted only of "one day – one afternoon, really – messing with it. The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish."  An additional factor behind scrapping the song was a technical defect in the original recording. As with "Real Love", a 60Hz mains hum can be heard throughout Lennon's demo recording. However, it was noticeably louder on '"Now and Then", making it much harder to remove. The project was largely shelved due to George Harrison's dislike of the song due to extremely bad recording (technological improvement in 2023 allows for better segregation of Lennon's voice and the muddy tape itself). McCartney later stated that Harrison called Lennon's demo recording "fucking rubbish".  McCartney told Q in 1997 that "George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it."  During a Jeff Lynne documentary shown on BBC Four in 2012, Paul McCartney stated about the song: "And there was another one that we started working on, but George went off it... that one's still lingering around, so I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days."  McCartney said in October 2021 that he still hoped to finish the track. On 13 June 2023, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had "just finished" work on extracting Lennon's voice from an old demo of the latter's in order to complete the song, using (in his words) artificial intelligence. Dubbing the project "the final Beatles record", he did not name the song; however, BBC News reported it was likely that the song is "Now and Then" and that it would be released later in 2023. On the use of AI technology (more accurately, sound source separation technology), McCartney added in June 2023 that "nothing has been artificially or synthetically created. It's all real and we all play on it. We cleaned up some existing recordings – a process which has gone on for years." On 25 October 2023, an image of an orange-and-white cassette tape with the tape reel winding was published on the Beatles' official website and official social media accounts. The bottom left of the tape reads "Type I (Normal) Position", and the copyright section reads "Yoko Ono Lennon, MPL Communications Ltd, G.H. Estate Ltd and Startling Music Ltd." The following day, the song was officially announced as a double A-side single with a release date of 2 November 2023, backed with a new stereo remix of "Love Me Do". \nPaul McCartney and Giles Martin are credited as producers for the recording, while Jeff Lynne is credited for "additional production". Jackson's production company WingNut Films was confirmed to isolate instruments, vocals, and individual conversations utilising its audio restoration technology. The neural network called MAL (machine-assisted learning) – named after the Beatles' road manager Mal Evans, and as a pun to HAL 9000 of 2001: A Space Odyssey – was first used for the 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back, and later the 2022 mix of Revolver, based directly on four-track master tapes. WingNut applied the same technique to the Lennon's home recording of "Now and Then", while preserving the clarity of his vocal performance separated from the piano. The restoration was followed by an addition of a string section written by Martin, McCartney and Ben Foster, recorded at Capitol Studios. Finally, McCartney and Martin added portions of original vocal recordings of "Here, There and Everywhere", "Eleanor Rigby" and "Because" into the new song, following the methods used for the 2006 remix album Love. The finished track was produced by McCartney and Martin, and mixed by Spike Stent. A 12-minute documentary film Now and Then – The Last Beatles Song, written and directed by Oliver Murray, debuted on 1 November 2023 on the Beatles' YouTube channel. The short film tells the story behind the song, including commentary by McCartney, Starr, Harrison, as well as Sean Lennon and Jackson. The film also plays an excerpt of the upcoming release. To celebrate the release of "Now and Then," animated projection mappings of the cassette tape from The Beatles' website had popped up at Beatles-related locations across Liverpool, including the Strawberry Field, the road sign for Penny Lane, outside Lennon's childhood home, and The Cavern Club. The BBC prepared an extended edition of The One Show on BBC One, BBC Radio 2 podcast series Eras: The Beatles hosted by Martin Freeman, as well as other programming on BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer. iHeartMedia announced that 740 radio stations owned by them will simultaneously premiere "Now and Then" on 2 November 2023, and will air hourly on their Classic Rock stations. The music video for "Now and Then" is to be released on 3 November 2023, was directed by Jackson. It features never seen before film of the Beatles, including footage by Pete Best, scenes filmed during the 1995 recording sessions for The Anthology, as well as unseen home movie footage of Harrison, and new footage of McCartney and Starr performing. Additionally, visual effects were produced by Wētā FX.	f

Many of the tracks on Revolver feature an electric guitar-rock sound that contrasts with their previous LP, the folk rock inspired Rubber Soul (1965). In Britain, the fourteen tracks from Revolver were released to radio stations throughout July 1966, "building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career".\n\nIt reached number one on both the British chart and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively.

It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 television film of the same name. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label, while the Capitol Records LP release in the US and Canada occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. In 1976, Parlophone released the eleven-track LP in the UK. When recording their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since Revolver (1966). The project was initiated by Paul McCartney in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song "Magical Mystery Tour", it lay dormant until the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with Transcendental Meditation under teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The sessions have been characterised by some biographers as aimless and unfocused, with the band members overly indulging in sound experimentation and exerting greater control over production. McCartney contributed three of the soundtrack songs, including the widely covered "The Fool on the Hill", while John Lennon and George Harrison contributed "I Am the Walrus" and "Blue Jay Way", respectively. The sessions also produced "Hello, Goodbye", issued as a single accompanying the soundtrack record, and items of incidental music for the film, including "Flying". Further to the Beatles' desire to experiment with record formats and packaging, the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet containing song lyrics, colour photos from film production, and colour story illustrations by cartoonist Bob Gibson. Despite widespread media criticism of the Magical Mystery Tour film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by Record Retailer and peaked at number 2 on the magazine's singles chart (later the UK Singles Chart) behind "Hello, Goodbye". The album topped Billboard's Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969. With the international standardisation of the Beatles' catalogue in 1987, Magical Mystery Tour became the only Capitol-generated LP to supersede the band's intended format and form part of their core catalogue.	f

It was released in the United Kingdom on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, eight months after the band's debut, "Please Please Me". Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and "Don't Bother Me", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&B hits). The sessions also yielded the non-album single, "I Want to Hold Your Hand" backed by "This Boy". The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with. In the United States, the album's tracks were unevenly split over the group's first two albums released on Capitol Records: Meet the Beatles! and The Beatles' Second Album. It was also released in Canada under the name, "Beatlemania! With the Beatles". The album was ranked number 420 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2010). It was also voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).	f

Many of the tracks on Revolver feature an electric guitar-rock sound that contrasts with their previous LP, the folk rock inspired Rubber Soul (1965). In Britain, the fourteen tracks from Revolver were released to radio stations throughout July 1966, "building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career".\n\nIt reached number one on both the British chart and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively. The album was remastered 9 September 2009 for the first time since its 1987 digital compact disc release. Placed at number 1 in the All-Time Top 1000 Albums and number 3 in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the album is often regarded as one of the greatest achievements in music history and one of the Beatles' greatest studio achievements.	f

It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released "Yellow Submarine" and "All You Need Is Love". The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before – and issued two months after – the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the "White Album") and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters. Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed.	f

In sharp contrast with other Beatles remasters available, the songs were fully remixed by Peter Cobbin at Abbey Road from the original multitrack tapes, something not done for the original CD release of the Beatles catalogue in the late 1980s (except for Help! and Rubber Soul), nor the 2009 remastered albums. The remixed tracks of the album feature many alterations and adjustments from the original stereo recordings. Almost all of The Beatles songs included in the film are on Yellow Submarine Songtrack. An exception is "A Day in the Life", which was not put in because EMI "did not want too many songs from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to be included". Although all of the tracks were remixed, the songs included on Songtrack are the standard catalogue recordings that were previously available on other releases. Consequently, the extra verse of "It's All Too Much" or the off-the-cuff rendition of "Think for Yourself" heard in the film are not included on the album.	f

Cole. The song was released on January 23, 2019, through Dreamville Records, Roc Nation and Interscope Records, as the first single from Dreamville's 2019 compilation album, Revenge of the Dreamers III. The song was written by J. Cole, Allan Felder, Norman Harris, and Tyler Williams and produced by T-Minus and Cole. It was serviced to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio on February 5, 2019. The track contains a sample from "Wake Up to Me", written by Felder and Harris, as performed by First Choice. On the song, J. Cole explores "his place between the old and new generations of hip hop, making him the 'middle child' of rap. On January 20, 2019, J. Cole cleared his Instagram page, the next day Cole cryptically posted a series of posts with lines from the song. They read: I'm Counting My Bullets, I'm Loading My Clips, I'm Writing Down Names, and I'm Making A List, Cole later deleted the posts. Later that same day, Cole announced on social media that he was releasing "Middle Child" on January 23, 2019, at 9:00 PM EST, and uploaded the cover which featured the song's title capitalized over a grey background. On January 25, 2019, in an interview with Complex, producer T-Minus revealed that they made the song about two months before the highly promoted Dreamville recording sessions, which were held the same month "Middle Child" was released. He also spoke about the process he and Cole took making the song:\nNo. Well, the way we work is we kind of just start from scratch, and we just brainstorm from there. Him and his manager had an idea to pull a sample out, so we went online and we found this really cool loop. The moment we heard it, we all reacted to it. Cole fell in love with it, and I could tell he had the vision for what he wanted. So he heard the sample and we were like, "Yo, we gotta do something on this." So we started filling the track out. It all happened in one day. We filled this beat out, he started writing to it, he recorded it—it was pretty much done within that day. The whole record. It was just a moment and it was actually one of the last days of sessions that we did. We did like a five day run of just working, and it was the last day, so it came right in the nick of time. "Middle Child" was produced by both J. Cole and Canadian hip-hop producer T-Minus. The song includes an exclusive multi-track sample of the horns section from "Wake Up to Me" by '70s Philadelphia trio First Choice, which was found and cleared through music licensing site Tracklib. This allowed them to isolate horns before adding in the drums. In an episode of Genius' Deconstructed, T-Minus explained he "put some reverb on  to give it that effect of it being a little bit more airy, a little bit bigger". Next was the addition of drums to the song, which T-Minus said was reminiscent of KOD "'cause a lot of it's very like stuttery kind of hats, very short but rhythmic". The drums added a variety of sounds, but J. Cole wanted to add an 808 pattern to the song, with the beat going from high to low. T-Minus noted the 808 for being "really hard" and also incorporated hi-hats to add "more energy to the song when it drops". The last production detail was including T-Minus' signature "trippy vibe", which he previously utilized on song like Kendrick Lamar's "Swimming Pools (Drank)" and Lil Wayne's "She Will"—"at the end of the record, we kind of added this effect to make everything kind of sound dark and kind of trippy". With only one day of tracking, the song debuted at number 26 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The following week, the song peaked at number 4, later becoming J. Cole's best performing track and highest-charting song until the release of My Life with 21 Savage & Morray, which peaked at number two. The song also peaked at number 2 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. An accompanying music video for the track was uploaded onto Cole's official YouTube channel on February 25, 2019. Cole announced the video via Twitter on February 22, 2019. The video was shot in Georgia, and was directed by fellow North Carolina rapper Mez, and features cameos from Dreamville artists Lute, Omen and Cozz. The video serves as Mez' first directed video. In an interview with Complex, Mez spoke about the creation of the video, he said:\nI came up with everything from scratch, but  Scott  had an idea for the Bentley. He was like, "Man, we should get the Bentley dirty, we should ride it through the mud," you know what I mean? And we ended up having a conversation about how to expand on that idea. It's funny because we're all from North Carolina, so mudding cars is something we all know and understand. But when they said that, I then came up with the whole concept for the video. I was like, "Oh, I know what I want it to be." The whole video is a concept. It's like a flip of Middle America: the NASCAR shit, the mudding shit, the hunting shit, everything. Almost every single shot—even in the grocery store setting, with the white woman purchasing the black girl's features, you know what I'm saying? Reviewing the music video, Laura Dzubay of The Michigan Daily said, "The visuals used in the "MIDDLE CHILD" video are very evocative: Between the lit-up marching band, the covered dead bodies, the stuffed rappers' heads on the mantle and the woman at the end picking a Saran-wrapped head out of a sale freezer at the grocery store, it's almost hard to land on which theme (if any) might be the most significant. What does seem clear is that J. Cole is asserting his readiness to dominate the music scene no matter which direction it takes next." Writing for The Fader, Jordan Darville described the video as "a fun, symbolic, and provocative set of visuals. J. Cole performed "Middle Child" at the 2019 NBA All-Star Game for its halftime show on February 17, 2019, in Charlotte, North Carolina.	f

The album also touches on other topics such as love and fatherhood.\n\nThe album was supported by two singles: "Deja Vu," and "Neighbors". All 10 songs from 4 Your Eyez Only debuted in the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100. Cole achieved twelve simultaneous Hot 100 entries in a single week. Promoting the release, Cole released a one-hour documentary (by the same name) on April 15, 2017, on HBO, featuring music from the album.

The 12-track album serves as a follow up to his 2016 album, 4 Your Eyez Only. Unlike his last two albums, KOD has a lone feature from an artist named kiLL Edward—a pitched-down version of Cole’s voice that serves as his alter ego.\n\nLeading up to the album debut, Cole hosted many exclusive listening events where he played the project in full. According to Chris Uño, who was in attendance at J. Cole’s surprise listening party at New York’s Grammercy Theatre, the “KOD” title can be taken three different ways:\n\n• Kids On Drugs\n• King OverDosed\n• Kill Our Demons\n\nThe album’s release date of April 20, 2018, could be a reference to the “420” code in cannabis culture, which includes smoking at 4:20 p.m. and on April 20th. The album’s cover art, speculated album title abbreviations, and frequent mentions of drug use in lyrics of songs support this notion.\n\nChris Uño also reported that the album was recorded in the span of two weeks, and contains no features, making it his third album in a row to not contain guest features. This report turned out to be somewhat true. The album’s only listed feature is KiLL edward, who turned out to actually be J. Cole, pitched down.\n\nFollowing the listening party, Cole took to Twitter to announce the album. The album art and tracklist were revealed on April 18th, two days before the album released.	f

It was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker (as Roy Baker), John Anthony, and Queen.\n\nThe album was influenced by the seaside rock, hard rock, and heavy metal of the day and covers subjects such as folklore ("My Fairy King") and religion ("Jesus"). Lead singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks. Lead guitarist Brian May contributed four songs, including "Doing All Right" which was co-written by Smile band-mate Tim Staffell. Drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang "Modern Times Rock and Roll." The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of "Seven Seas of Rhye". The band included the comment 'No synthesizers' on the album sleeve, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects processed by guitar and vocal sounds as synthesizers. Bassist John Deacon was credited on the sleeve notes of the original vinyl release as "Deacon John", as Mercury and Taylor thought this may make him sound more interesting.\n\nQueen had been playing the club and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when the band had a chance opportunity to test out the new recording facilities of De Lane Lea Studios. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they put together a polished demo tape of five songs: "Keep Yourself Alive," "The Night Comes Down," "Great King Rat," "Jesus," and "Liar". Despite the demo tape's quality, the band received only one offer from a record company - a low bid from Chrysalis Records, which they used to try to entice other companies.\n\nThey were finally taken aboard in 1972 by Norman and Barry Sheffield, who were setting up Trident Studios; however, Queen were allowed to record only during the studio's downtime, after the paying artists had left, which was usually between 3am and 7am. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Cable, who was working on a version of "I Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back." Mercury enlisted Brian May and Roger Taylor to record the tracks. These recordings were released on a single under the name Larry Lurex.\n\nThe arrangement of recording only during downtime lasted from June to November 1972. The limitations this imposed on them led the band to focus on completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy Thomas Baker asked them to re-record the songs with better equipment. "Keep Yourself Alive" was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it once again, but during the mixing sessions, no mix met their standards until engineer Mike Stone stepped in. After seven or eight failed attempts, Stone's first try met with Queen's approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and eventually co-produce their next five albums. The first, rejected re-record of "Keep Yourself Alive" was later released by Hollywood Records in the United States, titled "(Long Lost Re-take)," with Brian May's approval. Another track that proved problematic was "Mad The Swine", which was recorded for the album but then derailed by Baker and Queen disagreeing on the quality of the percussion. With the issue unresolved, the track was left off the album. It re-surfaced in 1991 as both the B-side to the "Headlong" CD single in the UK, and on the Hollywood Records re-release of the album. The version of "The Night Comes Down" which appears on the album is, in fact, the De Lane Lea demo recording, as its quality was apparently up to the standards of the rest of album's recordings.\n\nOther recordings from this period, such as two Smile tracks ("Silver Salmon" and "Polar Bear"), "Rock And Roll Medley" (a live encore staple from the era), and the infamous track "Hangman" (whose existence was long denied officially, beyond live concert recordings), have surfaced in the form of acetate pressings, now owned legitimately by private collectors.\n\nThough the album was completed and fully mixed by November 1972, Trident spent months trying to get a record company to release it. After eight months of failing that, they simply released it themselves in 1973. During this time, Queen had begun writing material for their next album, but they were disheartened by the current album's delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, "Keep Yourself Alive" (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version) was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 July and 13th respectively). The track length was edited for release in the US, from 3:47 to 3:30. The US single was issued in October. All countries had the B-side "Son And Daughter". The album was released in the US on 4 September.\n\nElektra Records released a single of "Liar" in a heavily edited form (without the band's knowledge) on 14 February 1974, with the B-side "Doing All Right". Elektra later re-issued the edited version of "Keep Yourself Alive" in July of 1975, this time with the rare double B-side (rare for a 7" single) of "Lily Of The Valley" and "God Save the Queen". Both versions are unique compared to the album versions.\n\nHollywood Records released a CD single featuring five versions of "Keep Yourself Alive" to promote the forthcoming "Crown Jewels" boxed set (1998). The versions on the CD are: "Long Lost Re-take", "BBC Session #1 Version", "Live Killers Version", "Album Version (Unremastered)", and "Album Version (1998 Remastered Version)".	f

It was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker (as Roy Baker), John Anthony, and Queen.\n\nThe album was influenced by the seaside rock, hard rock, and heavy metal of the day and covers subjects such as folklore ("My Fairy King") and religion ("Jesus"). Lead singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks. Lead guitarist Brian May contributed four songs, including "Doing All Right" which was co-written by Smile band-mate Tim Staffell. Drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang "Modern Times Rock and Roll." The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of "Seven Seas of Rhye". The band included the comment 'No synthesizers' on the album sleeve, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects processed by guitar and vocal sounds as synthesizers. Bassist John Deacon was credited on the sleeve notes of the original vinyl release as "Deacon John", as Mercury and Taylor thought this may make him sound more interesting.\n\nQueen had been playing the club and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when the band had a chance opportunity to test out the new recording facilities of De Lane Lea Studios. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they put together a polished demo tape of five songs: "Keep Yourself Alive," "The Night Comes Down," "Great King Rat," "Jesus," and "Liar". Despite the demo tape's quality, the band received only one offer from a record company - a low bid from Chrysalis Records, which they used to try to entice other companies.\n\nThey were finally taken aboard in 1972 by Norman and Barry Sheffield, who were setting up Trident Studios; however, Queen were allowed to record only during the studio's downtime, after the paying artists had left, which was usually between 3am and 7am. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Cable, who was working on a version of "I Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back." Mercury enlisted Brian May and Roger Taylor to record the tracks. These recordings were released on a single under the name Larry Lurex.\n\nThe arrangement of recording only during downtime lasted from June to November 1972. The limitations this imposed on them led the band to focus on completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy Thomas Baker asked them to re-record the songs with better equipment. "Keep Yourself Alive" was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it once again, but during the mixing sessions, no mix met their standards until engineer Mike Stone stepped in. After seven or eight failed attempts, Stone's first try met with Queen's approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and eventually co-produce their next five albums.

Lead singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks. Lead guitarist Brian May contributed four songs, including "Doing All Right" which was co-written by Smile band-mate Tim Staffell. Drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang "Modern Times Rock and Roll." The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of "Seven Seas of Rhye". The band included the comment 'No synthesizers' on the album sleeve, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects processed by guitar and vocal sounds as synthesizers. Bassist John Deacon was credited on the sleeve notes of the original vinyl release as "Deacon John", as Mercury and Taylor thought this may make him sound more interesting.\n\nQueen had been playing the club and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when the band had a chance opportunity to test out the new recording facilities of De Lane Lea Studios. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they put together a polished demo tape of five songs: "Keep Yourself Alive," "The Night Comes Down," "Great King Rat," "Jesus," and "Liar". Despite the demo tape's quality, the band received only one offer from a record company - a low bid from Chrysalis Records, which they used to try to entice other companies.\n\nThey were finally taken aboard in 1972 by Norman and Barry Sheffield, who were setting up Trident Studios; however, Queen were allowed to record only during the studio's downtime, after the paying artists had left, which was usually between 3am and 7am. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Cable, who was working on a version of "I Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back." Mercury enlisted Brian May and Roger Taylor to record the tracks. These recordings were released on a single under the name Larry Lurex.\n\nThe arrangement of recording only during downtime lasted from June to November 1972. The limitations this imposed on them led the band to focus on completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy Thomas Baker asked them to re-record the songs with better equipment. "Keep Yourself Alive" was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it once again, but during the mixing sessions, no mix met their standards until engineer Mike Stone stepped in. After seven or eight failed attempts, Stone's first try met with Queen's approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and eventually co-produce their next five albums. The first, rejected re-record of "Keep Yourself Alive" was later released by Hollywood Records in the United States, titled "(Long Lost Re-take)," with Brian May's approval. Another track that proved problematic was "Mad The Swine", which was recorded for the album but then derailed by Baker and Queen disagreeing on the quality of the percussion. With the issue unresolved, the track was left off the album. It re-surfaced in 1991 as both the B-side to the "Headlong" CD single in the UK, and on the Hollywood Records re-release of the album. The version of "The Night Comes Down" which appears on the album is, in fact, the De Lane Lea demo recording, as its quality was apparently up to the standards of the rest of album's recordings.\n\nOther recordings from this period, such as two Smile tracks ("Silver Salmon" and "Polar Bear"), "Rock And Roll Medley" (a live encore staple from the era), and the infamous track "Hangman" (whose existence was long denied officially, beyond live concert recordings), have surfaced in the form of acetate pressings, now owned legitimately by private collectors.\n\nThough the album was completed and fully mixed by November 1972, Trident spent months trying to get a record company to release it. After eight months of failing that, they simply released it themselves in 1973. During this time, Queen had begun writing material for their next album, but they were disheartened by the current album's delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, "Keep Yourself Alive" (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version) was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 July and 13th respectively). The track length was edited for release in the US, from 3:47 to 3:30. The US single was issued in October. All countries had the B-side "Son And Daughter". The album was released in the US on 4 September.\n\nElektra Records released a single of "Liar" in a heavily edited form (without the band's knowledge) on 14 February 1974, with the B-side "Doing All Right". Elektra later re-issued the edited version of "Keep Yourself Alive" in July of 1975, this time with the rare double B-side (rare for a 7" single) of "Lily Of The Valley" and "God Save the Queen". Both versions are unique compared to the album versions.\n\nHollywood Records released a CD single featuring five versions of "Keep Yourself Alive" to promote the forthcoming "Crown Jewels" boxed set (1998). The versions on the CD are: "Long Lost Re-take", "BBC Session #1 Version", "Live Killers Version", "Album Version (Unremastered)", and "Album Version (1998 Remastered Version)".	f

After the release of their previous album Smoke + Mirrors and its respective world tour, a self-imposed hiatus for 2016 and cryptic messages from the band through their social media gained anticipation for their third album; it was finally announced on May 9, 2017, along with the initiation of its pre-order. In comparison to Smoke + Mirrors and their 2012 debut Night Visions, frontman Dan Reynolds called the album an "evolution" for the band.\n\nEvolve peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard 200, and received mixed reviews from critics; some acknowledged the band's claim of evolution, while others described it as lifeless and commercially oriented. The album was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.	f

Frontman Dan Reynolds described "Origins" as a "sister album" to "Evolve", and that it would complete a cycle of their music. \n\n"Origins" has received generally mixed reviews from critics, but many claimed that the album is an improvement from their previous work "Evolve". The album was preceded by four singles: "Natural", "Zero", "Machine" and "Bad Liar". An additional single, "Birds", was released in 2019. \n\nThe album cover for "Origins", along with several pieces of merchandise revolving around the album were leaked online on October 2, 2018. The following day, Imagine Dragons officially announced the album to the public with a trailer. Within the trailer, the band spoke about why they were releasing a new album so soon after their previous album "Evolve", along with just finishing the Evolve World Tour in September 2018. Lead singer Dan Reynolds stated that although bands typically take a break for a while after touring, the band had already written songs that felt right to produce and release immediately, as they would be in a completely different place in the future.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, "Natural" was released as the lead single. To promote the single, it was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 College Football season. The song has since peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its music video starring the band was released on August 24, 2018.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, "Zero" was released as the second single. The song is featured in the Disney animated film Ralph Breaks the Internet and was included in its second official trailer, along with the ending credits for the film. The music video, which takes place in an arcade and includes several references to the film, was released on October 23, 2018. The song peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\nOn October 31, 2018, Imagine Dragons released the third single off the album, "Machine".\n\nOn November 6, 2018, "Bad Liar" was released as the fourth single. The song has since peaked at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the song was released on January 24, 2019.\n\nOn June 21, 2019, Imagine Dragons released the fifth single off the album, "Birds", featuring Italian singer Elisa. The original album version of the song had already charted in some countries earlier that month. An animated music video for the original song was released on July 23, 2019. In Europe, the song was charted in many countries' TOP 10 radio charts.	f

For Nelson, it was Sinatra’s talent for phrasing that he related to most. “He didn’t worry about  behind the beat or in front of the beat, or whatever—he could sing it either way,” Nelson told AARP The Magazine in early 2018. “And that’s the feel you have to have.”	f

Its ten songs consist entirely of pop standards that Nelson picked from among his favorites. Nelson asked Booker T. Jones, who was his neighbor in Malibu at the time, to arrange a version of "Moonlight in Vermont". Impressed with Jones's work, Nelson asked him to produce the entire album. Nelson's decision to record such well-known tracks was controversial among Columbia executives because he had distinguished himself in the outlaw country genre. Recording of the album took only ten days.	f

The songs "My Own Summer (Shove It)" and "Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)" were both released as singles with accompanying videos. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in June 1999, and was eventually certified platinum in 2011.\n\nAround the Fur has been described as alternative metal, nu metal, post-hardcore, and alternative rock. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter has since reflected, "We didn't really pay much attention to that. I remember when these subgenre names didn't exist. It was just metal. So I don't think we made a decision to step away  – we've never paid attention to what anyone else was doing. We just did what we thought was right, and tried to make a killer album." Producer Terry Date stated that the band wanted to become "more sophisticated" with Around the Fur. Lyrically, much of the album addresses topics such as juvenile perception, existential angst, sex, romance, violence, the death of loved ones, and break ups.\n\nThe band had gathered inspiration off of their own internal issues and personal incidents, as the four of them rented an apartment in Southern Seattle whilst they were writing and recording the album. Moreno and Carpenter recall the band often drank and partied frequently, even recalling random moments of writing where Cheng and Carpenter would smoke marijuana frequently together and write riffs together; the two later included their voicemail of them smoking out of a bong as a hidden track between MX and Damone.\n\nIt was the second album to feature Frank Delgado under additional personnel; he eventually joined the band officially in 1999. The song "Headup" featured additional vocals by Max Cavalera of Soulfly. It was written by Cavalera and Deftones singer Chino Moreno as a way of venting some of their pain over the loss of Dana Wells, Cavalera's stepson and Chino's friend. The band name "Soulfly" was taken from a portmanteau invented for the song. While the album's lyrics were included in the booklet, not every single word was printed. A good example is the song "Lhabia": In the verses, Moreno whispers statements that are hard to decipher. There is also one verse missing from the song "Headup".\n\nThe album cover was shot by photographer Rick Kosick during a late-night party in Seattle where the band was recording. Upon seeing the candid photo of a woman, the band decided that they wanted to use it as the album cover. Kosick was unsure who the woman was, so the band had to find and track her down to obtain permission to use the photo, which she eventually granted. The woman appearing on the cover is Washington State resident Lisa M. Hughes, a friend of Stephen Carpenter. Hughes spoke publicly about the cover for the first time during the album's 20th anniversary in 2017. Moreno has since expressed his dislike of the cover, calling it "horrible".	f

It was produced by Terry Date, who produced the band's first two albums, Adrenaline and Around the Fur. Recording sessions took place between August and December 1999 at Larrabee Sound Studios in West Hollywood and The Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, California.\n\nThe album marked a significant growth in the band's sound, incorporating influences from post-hardcore, trip-hop, shoegaze, progressive rock, and post-rock into the alternative metal sound which they had become known for. White Pony was also the first recording to feature Frank Delgado as a full-time member of the band on turntables and synthesizer; Delgado had previously worked with the band as a featured guest on their first two albums, producing sound effects on some songs. It was also the first Deftones album which Chino Moreno began to contribute rhythm guitar parts.\n\nAfter a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of "Change (In the House of Flies)" was the turning point where the band began working as a group.\n\nDespite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that "We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make." Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that "I basically didn’t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things. Once I did that I was able to sing about anything I wanted to, I could be a lot more general. There’s a lot of stuff on this record that people are going to question me about, and I can just remove myself from it. It’s not me. I’m writing a story here."\n\nAlthough the band initially wasn't intending to include guest musicians in the record, the album features additional vocals by Maynard James Keenan on "Passenger", Scott Weiland on "Rx Queen", and Rodleen Getsic on "Knife Prty".	f

It was released on Maverick Records on October 31, 2006. Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, Saturday Night Wrist marks the departure of mainstay Deftones producer Terry Date.\n\nThe band's fifth album was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within Deftones. Complicating matters, and inspiring many of the album's songs, were frontman Chino Moreno's drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The outcome, however, would be an album met with critical praise.\n\nThis is the last Deftones album to be released with bassist Chi Cheng before his near-fatal 2008 car accident and his subsequent death in 2013.	f

The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as "dynamic" with a full range of sound, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes. On September 19, 2012, the band released the song "Leathers" as a promotional single via a free download on their website. On October 8, 2012, "Leathers" was released as the album's first single. "Leathers" was also released as a limited edition cas-single with "Rosemary" as its B-side. On October 3, 2012, the song, "Tempest", premiered on PureVolume for streaming. "Tempest" was released as a single on October 9, 2012.\n\nKoi No Yokan marks the second album not to feature long-time bass player Chi Cheng, who had recently died from a near-fatal car accident in 2008.	f

It was released on May 20, 2003 through Maverick Records.\n\nOriginally to be titled Lovers, the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer Chino Moreno considered Lovers too obvious to the context of its material. The song "Lovers" does, however, exist on the UK single for "Hexagram" as a B-side. Deftones was the last album produced by Terry Date, who had collaborated with the band since Adrenaline, due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio, for example the band spent the first 3 days hanging around. They took considerable amounts of time to write and record music which frustrated Date as much as their lack of material when they entered the studio, the latter of the songs were written in the studio. "Needles and Pins" originally had two tentative names, one being "Aria" and the other being "White Woman". It was intended to be the opening track, but the band decided to change the song's title and order at the last minute.	f

It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band's next three albums. While they were initially unsuccessful, extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles "7 Words" and "Bored" (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay.  The band contributed the non-album track "Teething" to the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Crow: City of Angels and are also seen performing the song live during one of the film's scenes. The track "Engine No. 9" has since been covered by Korn and Suicide Silence, and appeared in the film Law Abiding Citizen.\n\nThe album spent 21 weeks on the Billboard Heatseekers chart reaching a peak position of 23.  When asked what he attributed the album's success to, Cheng responded, "One word: perseverance. We've been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity – and the kids can tell."  The album was RIAA certified gold on July 7, 1999 in recognition of 500,000 units sold.\n\nRegarding the recording of the album, Abe Cunningham said, "At the time we did the first record – which I really like and think is good – you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better."  Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded "really fast" and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone.  A review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's "surprisingly sophisticated drumming". It was also noted that "there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit."\n\nAdrenaline was certified platinum on September 23, 2008 by the RIAA, in recognition of 1,000,000 units sold.	f
2047	84	Ohms	2020-09-25	https://e-cdns-images.dzcdn.net/images/cover/f7d7a4a499eb046f454b7f94d53eed72/1000x1000-000000-80-0-0.jpg	album	Ohms (stylized as _Ohms on physical editions) is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on September 25, 2020, through Reprise Records. It reached number 5 on the Billboard 200.\n\nMusically, Ohms has been described as an alternative metal and dream pop album. It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the last time the band had worked with him was during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album on which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar.\n\nThe cover art was designed by Frank Maddocks, who had worked with Deftones on each of their albums since White Pony. There are total of 12,995 dots on the cover art. Many fans believed that the design paid tribute to the band's original bassist Chi Cheng, who died in 2013, as the eyes that appear on the cover art lined up closely with a photo of him. Band drummer Abe Cunningham stated in an interview that this was merely a coincidence, however. He added that the cover art idea reminded him of the 1980s, specifically the music video for Prince's 1984 song "When Doves Cry". Shortly before the album's release, Deftones launched the "Adopt a Dot" campaign, allowing for people to purchase one of the dots on the artwork as their own. A photo of the purchaser would then appear as the dot they purchased and be a part of the "Ohms Adopt a Dot digital experience" viewable online. All of the proceeds from the campaign were given to both the UC Davis Children's Hospital and Crew Nation relief fund.\n\nThe band began teasing the album's release with a week-long digital campaign in August 2020. Deftones released cryptic social media posts, their official website and animations through Spotify's Canvas feature that when solved revealed the word "ohms" and longitudinal coordinates for a billboard in Los Angeles teasing the album artwork. The campaign concluded with a formal announcement for Ohms and a music video for the album's first promotional song, "Ohms". The music video for "Ohms" was directed by Rafatoon and featured what Rolling Stone described as, "band performance video interspersed with scenes from a dystopian world, mirroring the musically and lyrically heavy song sentiments." At the time of release, vocalist Chino Moreno described "Ohms" as a "a good scope of where this record's at," though in a separate interview producer Terry Date didn't feel like the song was a good choice for the album's lead promotional track.\n\nDeftones were originally scheduled to tour North America in support of Ohms with Gojira and Poppy in July to September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed until 2021.\n\nOhms received acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 88, based on 19 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung thought that Deftones "take their signature beauty-meets-brutality assault, searching for balance across a tightly focused ten tracks." Yeung further stated: "As a unit, they haven't sounded this refreshed in years." Consequence of Sound's Joseph Schafer described Ohms as "their hardest-hitting effort in years" and "a record that hints at a purified blend of their contrasting influences in its finest moments." Ben Tipple of DIY praised Date’s production work and stated: "If any of Deftones’ previous records are guilty of lacking focus (you decide), ‘Ohms‘ is certainly safe from future vitriol."\n\nDescribing Ohms as "truly and honestly a breath of fresh air," Exclaim! critic Adam Wallis thought that the record was "just as unique and innovative as each album before it." The Independent's Roisin O'Connor regarded the album as "an intriguing addition to the band’s canon," while David McLaughlin Kerrang! likened the it to a "greatest hits  from a parallel plane of existence, yet dense enough to demand deeper exploration." Writing for NME, James McMahon described Ohms as "heavy stuff, both sonically and in emotional clout." Andy Crump of Paste regarded the album as "an engrossing refinement of what they’ve become over years of risk-taking and experimentation." Sputnikmusic staff critic SowingSeason thought that the record "surpasses Deftones’ other iconic releases is in its dense, unpredictable layering and sheer intensity." He further stated: "There aren’t many traits present on Ohms that we’ve never heard from the band before,... but they’ve woven all these glimpses of previous albums together and improved upon them in nearly every facet."\n\nIn a more mixed review, The Guardian's Dean Van Nguyen wrote that the album "lacks the lateral thinking that distinguished the band’s masterpiece, White Pony." Nevertheless, Nguyen further explained: "Still, by streamlining their sound, Deftones have made an album that proves that ferocity is not a diminishing resource."	f

It was released on 8 April 2016. The lead single Prayers/Triangles was released on 4 February 2016. The album was produced by Matt Hyde and Deftones. It features a guest appearance from Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell. Bassist Sergio Vega used a six-string bass guitar to record the new material, helping to explore a new, different sound.\n\nIn May 2015, Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) gave some details on the new album to Kerrang!: "The music is what inspires the lyrics and the songs have a lot of different moods. I'm not gonna say it's a happy record,  it's not a completely angry record".\n\nMoreno poked fun at one of Kanye West's tweets by stating: "Out of respect for Pac, Big, Stevie, Michael, Hendrix, Gore is ONE of the greatest albums not the greatest, just one of".\n\nA second single, Doomed User, was released on 16 March.	f

The album was released through Warner Bros. and Reprise Records on May 4, 2010. An album tentatively titled Eros was originally intended to be their sixth full-length release, but was not released due to bassist Chi Cheng entering a coma after a serious car accident that occurred in November 2008. The release of Eros was put on hold in favor of Diamond Eyes in June 2009. Former Quicksand bass player, Sergio Vega is featured on the album in substitution for Cheng.\n\nDiamond Eyes was originally scheduled to be released on April 27 through Warner Bros. Records/Reprise Records, but was pushed back three weeks to May 18, and later pushed forward to May 4, 2010. The latter release date change was possibly due to the album leaking onto the internet two months before the release date in March 2010. The first song released off the album, "Rocket Skates", was available for free download through the band's official website on February 23, 2010. The song had been included in Deftones live performances starting in October 2009, and will be released as a limited edition 7" vinyl single for international Record Store Day on April 17, 2010. The first radio single was the title track, "Diamond Eyes", which was released for airplay on March 30, 2010. The single was also was released as a digital download on March 23, 2010.\n\n"I don't like listening to people's problems - I like music. Music has been smothered with that complaining since the early-'90s. It gets old. Instead of going to the opposite side of the spectrum and listening to Black Eyed Peas, which is just straight silly, I choose to listen to more instrumental music. I do very little singing about myself on this record. I love songs where I can totally take myself out of being human. I can sing about really odd things, and they don't necessarily have to pertain to me at all. It paints a picture. Those are the kind of lyrics I grew up with - like The Cure. Really visual images and no storytelling." --- Chino Moreno	f

It reached number 5 on the Billboard 200.\n\nMusically, Ohms has been described as an alternative metal and dream pop album. It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the last time the band had worked with him was during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album on which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar.\n\nThe cover art was designed by Frank Maddocks, who had worked with Deftones on each of their albums since White Pony. There are total of 12,995 dots on the cover art. Many fans believed that the design paid tribute to the band's original bassist Chi Cheng, who died in 2013, as the eyes that appear on the cover art lined up closely with a photo of him. Band drummer Abe Cunningham stated in an interview that this was merely a coincidence, however. He added that the cover art idea reminded him of the 1980s, specifically the music video for Prince's 1984 song "When Doves Cry". Shortly before the album's release, Deftones launched the "Adopt a Dot" campaign, allowing for people to purchase one of the dots on the artwork as their own. A photo of the purchaser would then appear as the dot they purchased and be a part of the "Ohms Adopt a Dot digital experience" viewable online. All of the proceeds from the campaign were given to both the UC Davis Children's Hospital and Crew Nation relief fund.\n\nThe band began teasing the album's release with a week-long digital campaign in August 2020. Deftones released cryptic social media posts, their official website and animations through Spotify's Canvas feature that when solved revealed the word "ohms" and longitudinal coordinates for a billboard in Los Angeles teasing the album artwork. The campaign concluded with a formal announcement for Ohms and a music video for the album's first promotional song, "Ohms". The music video for "Ohms" was directed by Rafatoon and featured what Rolling Stone described as, "band performance video interspersed with scenes from a dystopian world, mirroring the musically and lyrically heavy song sentiments." At the time of release, vocalist Chino Moreno described "Ohms" as a "a good scope of where this record's at," though in a separate interview producer Terry Date didn't feel like the song was a good choice for the album's lead promotional track.\n\nDeftones were originally scheduled to tour North America in support of Ohms with Gojira and Poppy in July to September 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed until 2021.\n\nOhms received acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 88, based on 19 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung thought that Deftones "take their signature beauty-meets-brutality assault, searching for balance across a tightly focused ten tracks." Yeung further stated: "As a unit, they haven't sounded this refreshed in years." Consequence of Sound's Joseph Schafer described Ohms as "their hardest-hitting effort in years" and "a record that hints at a purified blend of their contrasting influences in its finest moments." Ben Tipple of DIY praised Date’s production work and stated: "If any of Deftones’ previous records are guilty of lacking focus (you decide), ‘Ohms‘ is certainly safe from future vitriol."\n\nDescribing Ohms as "truly and honestly a breath of fresh air," Exclaim! critic Adam Wallis thought that the record was "just as unique and innovative as each album before it." The Independent's Roisin O'Connor regarded the album as "an intriguing addition to the band’s canon," while David McLaughlin Kerrang! likened the it to a "greatest hits  from a parallel plane of existence, yet dense enough to demand deeper exploration." Writing for NME, James McMahon described Ohms as "heavy stuff, both sonically and in emotional clout." Andy Crump of Paste regarded the album as "an engrossing refinement of what they’ve become over years of risk-taking and experimentation." Sputnikmusic staff critic SowingSeason thought that the record "surpasses Deftones’ other iconic releases is in its dense, unpredictable layering and sheer intensity." He further stated: "There aren’t many traits present on Ohms that we’ve never heard from the band before,... but they’ve woven all these glimpses of previous albums together and improved upon them in nearly every facet."\n\nIn a more mixed review, The Guardian's Dean Van Nguyen wrote that the album "lacks the lateral thinking that distinguished the band’s masterpiece, White Pony." Nevertheless, Nguyen further explained: "Still, by streamlining their sound, Deftones have made an album that proves that ferocity is not a diminishing resource."	f

The artists most likely cut these tracks from the final project either because they didn’t like them as much or had issues with sample clearance.\n\nThis EP follows in the same footsteps as the base album: having sounds and themes that would be too “weird” for mainstream audiences.\n\nThere are even different sounds being discovered, such as the Spanish sample on “HERMANOS” and the deeper vocals on “Tell Me Where To Go”.	f

The theme for T'Challa, the titular protagonist, in the first film, was altered and integrated into the score. Recording for the soundtrack and score happened simultaneously in Mexico, Lagos with additional recording happened in Los Angeles. He collaborated with contemporary artists — rappers, singers, indigenous musicians, and indigenous singers for recording the original songs in the album.\n\nA soundtrack extended play titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Prologue was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 25, 2022, featuring three songs, including Tems cover of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry" which was featured in the teaser trailer.

It was released on April 10, 2006, by Def Jam Recordings. For the production of the album, Rihanna worked with Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken, Stargate, J. R. Rotem and label-mate Ne-Yo, who wrote the album's second single. A Girl like Me is a pop, reggae and R&B album influenced by Rihanna's Caribbean roots. The album also incorporates elements of dancehall and rock, as well as ballads, which music critics were ambivalent towards.\n\nSome critics gave the album positive reviews, stating that Rihanna gracefully avoided the sophomore disappointment while others compared the album to her previous effort. A Girl like Me was released less than eight months after Rihanna's debut album. It peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 and on the UK Albums Chart. The album was successful in other countries as well, entering the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan, while topping the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nA Girl like Me spawned four singles: "SOS", which became Rihanna's first single to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, "Unfaithful" and "Break It Off", both reaching the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the album's third single, "We Ride", failed to reprise the success of the album's other singles. The album was re-released as an expanded two-disc deluxe package in Germany, which includes remixes to both Rihanna's debut single, "Pon de Replay", and "If It's Lovin' that You Want". The album has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). To promote both A Girl Like Me and her debut record, Rihanna embarked on her debut headlining concert tour, entitled Rihanna: Live in Concert in 2006.	f

"Please Me" is an R&B, hip hop and soul ballad that is reminiscent of the 1990's R&B with "trap stylings"; its lyrics are about two lovers flirting with each other and the way their night will proceed before they go into a bedroom.	f

It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. In addition, it had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a woman. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the "Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time."\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album, with Rolling in the Deep, Someone like You and Set Fire to the Rain becoming international number-one songs, while Rumour Has It charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, 21 is one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year.	f

The album is Adele's first project since her contract with XL Recordings expired after the release of 25 (2015). The album's title alludes to the age the singer first married ex-husband Simon Konecki, and the album features themes of separation, divorce, motherhood, and the anxiety of fame.

The album is titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old and is termed a "make-up record". Its lyrical content features themes of Adele "yearning for her old self, her nostalgia", and "melancholia about the passage of time" according to an interview with the singer by Rolling Stone, as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous works, the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s R&B and organs.\n\n25 received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and Adele's vocal performance. Issued nearly five years after the release of her second album, the internationally successful 21, the album was widely anticipated and Adele's record labels promoted the album with an extensive marketing campaign. 25 became a massive commercial success, debuting at number one in 32 countries and breaking first-week sales records in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States. In the US, the album sold over 3.38 million copies in its first week of sales, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. 25 was the world's best-selling album of the year for 2015, with 17.4 million copies sold within the year, and has gone on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth-best selling album of the 21st century, the second-best selling album of the 2010s (behind 21), and one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Following 21, it was certified Diamond by the RIAA, making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums.	f

The album title, release date, and number of songs on the album were confirmed via Instagram on August 16. Chris first teased new music on June 17 via Instagram, stating:\n\nIf yall thought I wasn’t going to release a single for the summer …. Think again\n\nChris initially announced that his upcoming eleventh album would be “just the right amount of magic to digest,” moving away from 30+ albums such as October 2017’s Heartbreak on a Full Moon. However, following the release of “Sensational,” Chris took to Instagram to reveal that the 11:11 is a double album, with 11 tracks dropping at 11 A.M. and another 11 at 11 P.M. However, on November 9, he announced that the album would be released on the 10th.\n\nThe tracklist was confirmed via Instagram on November 6 and some of the features were teased. “Double Negative” was dropped from the final tracklist as it “did not make the deadline in time with lawyers” and was replaced with “Views.” According to a fan page, some additional features were planned, but were omitted, most likely due to label decisions.\n\n11:11 was preceded by 3 singles: the bouncy summertime-friendly “Summer Too Hot,” the afrobeats-inspired “Sensational,” and the Jamaican Patois influenced “Nightmares.”	f

The album was a major commercial success, going five times platinum in 1999 and etching Sublime into a permanent place among the stars of mid-90s alternative rock. Its most popular single, "What I Got", was an uncharacteristically poppy song; the bulk of the album was faithful to Sublime's ska, dub, and reggae influences, with tempos ranging from the frantic — such as "Seed," "Same in the End," and "Paddle Out" — to the slow and deliberate, such as "Pawn Shop" and "Jailhouse." "Jailhouse", is a cover of a Bob Marley song which can be found on many Bob Marley albums including "The Wailing Wailers at Studio One, Vol. 2".\n\nThe musical styles throughout the album vary nearly as much as the subjects discussed, ranging from the mellow Hip Hop groove of "Doin' Time" and reggae beat of "Caress Me Down" to the pop-rock "What I Got" and the hardcore punk sound of "Paddle Out". The genre-crossing musical diversity expressed on the album is one of the more compelling reasons for the record's wide mainstream appeal.\n\nThe album marked the band's debut on a major label (MCA) after several releases on Skunk Records.	f

Sublime would not achieve any mainstream success until the release of their eponymous album in 1996, two months after the death of their lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell. As of 2011, the album has certified sales of two million copies in the US and is Sublime's second best-selling studio album there (the self-titled album leads with six million). Along with The Offspring's 1994 album Smash, 40oz. to Freedom is one of the highest-selling independently released albums of all time.	f
